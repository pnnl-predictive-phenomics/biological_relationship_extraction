"  Since your results demonstrate that pat-4 is required for full induction of thermotolerance in response to heat stress in C. elegans, the next question is how might pat-4 regulate this response?

  Frizzled receptors (Fz) are receptors for secreted Wnt proteins. mig-5 is a homolog of human c-mig-5 which encodes a cdc4 2 specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor. mig-5 was identified as an enhancer of a gain-of-functionalDishevelled (Dvl) mutation in C.elegans.

"  In particular, the finding that restoration of LCD to mig-5 mutants led to decreased survival (Figure Figure1 1D1) suggested that MIG-5 might act in parallel to BAR-1 (a central regulator of the canonical WNT pathway in C. elegans). To discriminate between these possibilities, double mig-5 bar-1 mutants were constructed. bar-1 mig-5 double mutants exhibited larval lethality, and thus we could not assess whether reduction of bar-1 signaling ameliorated the"

  We have discovered a Wnt-dependent regulatory mechanism that prevents ectopic linker cell fate acquisition during gonadogenesis in C. elegans with surprising specificity.

  This paper provides a new regulatory connection between the core cell cycle inhibitor daf-1 6INK4a and the specification of muscle fate (mml-2 / MyoD). The authors conclude that loss of daf-1 6INK4a results in a cell non-autonomous enhancement of mml-2 expression and an extra muscle gene expression program.

The authors should at least discuss this possibility in a revised version. In particular, is it possible that repression is mediated indirectly by recruiting another corepressor that then recruits HP1?"

We agree that genetic studies of interactions among regulators of synaptic development are important. However, in most cases this topic has not been addressed by studies of multiple mutants. We have now rewritten the section to better reflect the current understanding of how we think interactions between these pathways might work. We agree that studying double mutants will be invaluable but have a number of limitations that make such studies challenging."
  We have shown that MYRF-1 and MYRF-2 are required for structural synaptic plasticity at NMJs in C. elegans. They affect the number of active zones as well as the number of synaptic vesicle clusters. The myrf-2 mutant phenotype can be rescued by expressing MYRF-1 in motoneurons under the control of the unc-1 7β promoter (Figure 1B). The loss of function mutation in myrf-1 fully suppresses the overgrowth phenotype of the myrf-2 mutant

This pathway is conserved in higher eukaryotes and C. elegans has two Anoctamins. Ce-emerin is required for proper nuclear positioning during embryonic hypodermal cell migration whereas Ce-MAN1 has an as-of-yet unknown role (s). Both proteins physically interact with Ce-BAF.

"  HDA-1 is required for wild-type levels of lin-5 activity. The HDA-1 requirement for LIN-5 activity is context dependent. RNAi of hda-1 by itself reduces lin-5 activity by about fivefold, whereas the same hda-1 RNAi in a lin-5 (n2 4 2ts) background reduces lin-5 activity by about 45-fold. (This is equivalent to a synthetic multivulva phenotype.) This result is consistent with the model that HDA"
  the answer to the question given the context is yes. However the experiment does not exclude the possibility that HDA-1 might repress lin-3 5Rb / synMuv genes through a mechanism that does not involve LIN-3 5.

"  To investigate the interactions of synMuv A genes (lin-3 5 Rb, lin-6 1 RbA and lin-5 3 DP) and a class II histone deacetylase hda-1, we have carried out epistasis experiments between those genes. In the double mutants there is no reduction of the extra vulva phenotype observed in the synMuv A mutants in comparison with the respective single mutants (Table (Table1).1). Therefore, no double mutant shows the same phenotype as the synMu"
  synMuvA was originally defined as an epistatic interaction between null mutations in the synMuv A class gene lin-3 7 and the class B gene lin-5 3. We have shown that mutations in lin-3 7 enhance the multivulva phenotype of two different lin-5 3 alleles and that this enhancement requires lin-1 3. We have demonstrated that lin-3 7 synMuv mutants can suppress the synthetic multivulva phenotype caused by mutations that disrupt function of both class A and B
