2361334	mig-10	vab-8	No (The given context does not provide any information about an interaction between mig-10 and vab-8. It only mentions that both are among the four different loci.)
2361334	mig-10	vab-8	"To accurately answer the question, it would require more explicit information about the interactions between mig-10 and vab-8 due to the presence of mutations. However, since mutations at both mig-10"
2361334	mig-10	unc-39	"The provided context does not give any information about the interactions between ""mig-10"" and ""unc-39"". It only lists four different loci that include both ""mig-10"" and ""unc-39"" but does not specify"
2361334	vab-8	unc-39	"In the given context, it appears that there is a connection between vab-8 and unc-39 since they are listed together. However, without further information or explanation, we cannot definitively label "
24462208	paxt-1	XRN2	"Yes (Interpretation: Inactivation of paxt-1 results in a reduction of XRN2 levels, suggesting that there is an interaction between these two entities)"
24462208	paxt-1	xrn-2	"Yes (However, note that this interaction is through inactivation and reduction of levels, rather than a direct physical interaction. But in terms of biochemical relationship, they are connected.)"
24462208	R05D11.6	XRN2	Yes
25446273	hda-1	lin-53	"Yes (As both ""hda-1"" and ""lin-53"" are listed within the same context.)"
26232604	rcan-1	tax-6	"Yes (rcan-1 interacts with tax-6 in a sense that the cryophilic behavior is dependent on rcan-1, and it gets rescued when tax-6 is expressed in AFD neurons)"
26232604	rcan-1	tax-6	Yes (This answer is based on the given context where the suppression of thermotaxis phenotypes in both rcan-1 and tax-6 mutants suggests an interaction between those two genes.)
26232604	rcan-1	tax-6	Yes
26552888	PTEN	FOXO	"No, the context indicates that the interaction required for the neutralization of insulinIGF1 signalling involves DAF18 (PTEN) but not DAF16 (FOXO). This suggests that while PTEN has a role in this p"
26598553	pgl-3	pgl-1	"Yes (However, keep in mind that the nature or type of interaction is not specified in this context.)"
27150041	Smu1	RED	"The context indicates that Smu1 and RED are both alternative splicing factors, which suggests that they might belong to the same biological pathway or process. However, it does not explicitly state t"
27150041	Smu1	RED	"Yes (since the context mentions that they have been jointly implicated, implying that there might be some level of interaction between Smu1 and RED)."
27150041	Smu1	RED	Yes
27150041	Smu1	RED	Yes
27150041	Smu1	RED	Yes
27150041	Smu1	RED	Yes
3949074	zyg-11	zyg-9	"No (However, the context does not explicitly mention any interaction between these loci, but they are listed as being identified at two separate loci.)"
3949074	zyg-11	zyg-9	No (The context only describes the effects of mutations on each locus separately without explicitly stating an interaction between zyg-11 and zyg-9.)
8111975	mog-4	mog-5	"No (The context does not provide any specific information regarding an interaction between mog-4 and mog-5, only that they are among a group of five genes that influence something.)"
8111975	mog-4	mog-2	No (The context only mentions the identification of five genes without providing information on any interaction between mog-4 and mog-2.)
8111975	fem-3	mog-1	"Yes, it is suggested in the context that fem-3 may interact with mog-1 since fem-3 mog6 mutations affect the translational controls of mog-1 and other maternal mRNAs. This interaction may occur indir"
8111975	fem-3	mog-2	"No (However, it is important to note that although fem-3 might have an influence before mog-2 in this context, it could potentially imply some sort of relationship or interaction between them, althou"
8111975	mog-1	mog-2	"In the given context, mog-1 appears to share similar defects with mog-2, although it is mentioned in the context of mog-1 mog6 mutants. However, this context doesn't explicitly state that mog-1 direc"
8111975	mog-1	mog-2	Yes
8111975	mog-5	mog-2	"No (The context only mentions the identification of five genes that influence something, but it does not provide any information about interactive relationships between mog-5 and mog-2.)"
8293978	lin-12	sel-10	"No (The context only states that lin-12 and selar40 are genes with a known relationship to sel-10 through being suppressors or enhancers, but it doesn't explicitly mention an interaction between lin-"
8293978	lin-12	sel-10	"Yes (This answer assumes that the ""ability to bypass"" implies some form of interaction between lin-12 and sel-10.)"
9553113	ife-1	ife-3	No (The context does not provide any information about interactions between ife-1 and ife-3. It only mentions that they are named among three elF4Elike genes.)
9604928	egl-1	ced-9	"Yes (However, keep in mind that the interaction is described as a negative regulation between the egl-1 and ced-9 genes.)"
9609829	mes-2	mes-6	"The context does not provide explicit information about any interaction between ""mes-2"" and ""mes-6"". It only lists that they are among the four genes contributing to maternal influence. Due to the la"
9609829	mes-2	mes-6	"No, the provided context does not explicitly state that mes-2 interacts with mes-6. It only mentions they are both part of the Polycomb group proteins. Further information would be needed to establis"
9609830	mes-2	mes-6	"No (The context only mentions that these four genes - mes-2, mes-3, mes-4, and mes-6 - are all essential for normal proliferation, but it does not explicitly state that mes-2 interacts with mes-6.)"
9764821	mxl-1	mdl-1	"The context does not explicitly mention any interaction between mxl-1 and mdl-1. Any speculation about their interaction would be unsupported by the given information. So, the answer would be ""No"" wi"
9764821	mxl-1	mdl-1	Yes
9834184	pry-1	bar-1	"Yes (Explanation: Since egl20, pry-1, and bar-1 all function in a linear manner, it suggests that these elements may have some connection or interaction with each other, including the interaction bet"
9875852	lin-35	lin-53	"Yes (Explanation: Since it's mentioned that lin-35 and lin-53 antagonize something, it implies that they are affecting each other in some way. Antagonism refers to opposing or counteracting actions, "
9875852	lin-35	lin-53	"No (We cannot conclude that lin-35 interacts with lin-53 from the given context, as it only describes similarities between their encoded proteins.)"
9927601	ced-9	ced-3	"Yes (The given context implies that ced-9 is part of the same apoptotic execution machinery as ced-3 and ced-4, which suggest potential interactions between these components.)"
