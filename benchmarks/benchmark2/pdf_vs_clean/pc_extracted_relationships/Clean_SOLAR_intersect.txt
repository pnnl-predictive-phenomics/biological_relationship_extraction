24424777	brc-1	brd-1	Yes (In the given context, it appears that BRC-1 and BRD-1 interact as they seem to work together by suppressing HR activities and promoting genome instability along with SMC56.)
24516399	aak-2	aakb-2	Given that the context provided only mentions different subunits labeled aak1, aak-2, aakb1, aakb-2, and aakg15, it is implied that aak-2 is an individual subunit within a larger system. However, it 
24516399	aak-2	aakb-2	According to the given context, "aak-2" refers to the β2 subunit, whereas "aakb-2" appears to be unrelated as there is mention of the α2 and β1 subunits instead. Therefore, "aak-2" and "aakb-2" do no
24516399	aak-2	aakb-2	Based on the given context, it can be inferred that aak-2 can interact with both aakb1 and aakb-2 in dauer larvae. So the answer is "Yes".

27191843	vps-52	vps-53	To accurately provide an answer based solely on the given context, I cannot clearly determine whether "vps-52" interacts with "vps-53" or not. The context only implies that there could be a possible 
27191843	vps-52	vps-53	Yes, in the given context, since vps-52 is listed among the mutants that share certain characteristics along with vps-53, it can be inferred that vps-52 potentially interacts with vps-53.
27191843	vps-52	vps-53	Yes, in the given context, "vps-52" could potentially interact with "vps-53" since they are part of the GARPEARP common subunits along with vps51. The similarity in function between these three sugge
27191843	vps-52	vps-53	In the given context, it is implied that there exist mutants related to vps-52 and vps-53. While the context does not explicitly mention any interplay or interaction between vps-52 and vps-53, they b

27191843	vps-52	vps-53	Yes, in the given context, it can be inferred that "vps-52" and "vps-53" may interact, as both are associated with the promoters for expressing the yellow fluorescent protein Citrine. However, withou
27191843	vps-52	vps-53	It is not possible for me to answer the question with a simple "Yes" or "No" based solely on the given context. However, since vps-52 and vps-53 are mentioned in the same context, and vps-53 is descr
27191843	vps-52	vps-53	Based on the given context, it is not clear if "vps-52" interacts with "vps-53". The context only provides information about the promoter used for vps-52 and the expression pattern of vps-53 in neuro

27191843	vps-52	vps-54	In the given context, "vps-52" is mentioned within the context of a potential function independent of "vps-54" in regard to IDA1 trafficking. Although there is a mention of vps51, vps53, vps50, and C
27191843	vps-52	vps-54	Based on the given context, the answer would be "No." Vps-52 shares characteristics with vps51 and vps-53 mutants, but the context does not indicate any similarities between vps-52 and vps-54.
27191843	VPS51	VPS53	Yes
27191843	VPS51	VPS53	Yes
27191843	VPS51	VPS53	Yes, VPS51 interacts with VPS53 because both of them are subunits that are shared between the complex 3435 EARP and the GARP complex.
27191843	VPS51	VPS53	Yes, VPS51 interacted with VPS53 in this context as they were both pulled down with VPS50 used as a bait protein.
27191843	VPS51	VPS53	Yes, in the given context, VPS51 and VPS53 both "interact" with EIPR1 based on mass spectrometry results. However, it doesn't specify if VPS51 interacts directly with VPS53.
27191843	vps-51	vps-53	Based on the provided context alone, we cannot determine if "vps-51" interacts with "vps-53" since there is no information about their interaction or relationship. The context only informs us that th
27191843	vps-51	vps-53	Yes, in this context, VPS-51, VPS52, and VPS-53 are mentioned together as members of the rab2 pathway. This suggests that they likely interact with one another.
27191843	vps-51	vps-53	In this given context, there is no direct information about "vps-51" interacting with "vps-53". The context discusses traits shared by these mutants, but it doesn't specifically imply an interaction 
27191843	vps-51	vps-53	Yes, in this context, vps-51 is mentioned in relation to other protein mutants like vps52 and vps-53, suggesting that they might interact to some degree. However, please note that the provided contex

27191843	vps-51	vps-53	Given the provided context, it does not specifically mention an interaction between "vps-51" and "vps-53." The context discusses the expression patterns of "vps-51," "vps52," and "vps-53." To ascerta
27191843	vps-51	vps-53	Yes, in the given context, vps-51, vps52, and vps-53 appear to be related as they are all mentioned together in the study of mutants.
27191843	vps-51	vps-53	Yes, it appears that vps-51 and vps-53 may interact since both were mentioned together as causing the accumulation of IDA1 in their respective mutants. However, it is essential to note that the given
27191843	vps-51	vps-53	To provide an answer, I cannot assume a direct relationship between "vps-51" and "vps-53" from the given context alone. All the information provided pertains to the potential function of vps-51, vps5
27191843	vps-51	vps-53	Yes, in the context provided, "vps-51" can be considered to have similar phenotypic effects as "vps-53", as both produce mutants with shared phenotypes. However, it's essential to note that this anal
27191843	vps-51	vps-53	Yes, it seems that vps-51 can potentially interact with vps-53, as they are both mentioned as common subunits affecting the GARPEARP. However, it is important to note that this interpretation is sole
27191843	VPS53	VPS54	Yes, according to the given context, VPS53 (also known as syndetin) is related to VPS54 as they are both mentioned in the same source. However, it is important to note that the context does not provi
27191843	VPS53	VPS54	Yes
27191843	VPS53	VPS54	Yes, VPS53 interacts with the GARP complex, although it swaps VPS54 for VPS50 as a different subunit in this specific context.
27191843	vps-53	vps-54	In the given context, it appears that "vps-53" might have a separate function in IDA1 trafficking without involving "vps-54". Therefore, my answer is "No", as the context suggests that these two enti
27191843	vps-53	vps-54	No, based on the context provided, "vps-54" does not interact with "vps-53" because it is not included in the group that shares the phenomenon observed with "vps51", "vps52", and "vps-53" mutants.
27401555	daf-16	sgk-1	Based on the given context, it appears that daf-16 and sgk-1 are likely to interact, as they are being combined in a cross (mutation into a background). This indicates that researchers are investigat
27401555	daf-16	sgk-1	Yes, in this context, it seems that the daf-16 gene interacts or influences the function of the sgk-1 gene, given that the loss of daf-16 does not resolve the issue caused by the mutation in sgk-1.
27401555	daf-16	sgk-1	Based on the given context, the interaction between daf-16 and sgk-1 seems to be lacking. The genetic inactivation of daf-16 did not result in the reactivation of Pvit3GFP in the sgk-1 mutants. So, I
27401555	daf-16	sgk-1	Based on the given context, it appears that daf-16 and sgk-1 do interact, at least in the context of reporter expression and the Pvit3GFP regulatory system. However, deletion of daf-16 did not result
27401555	daf-16	sgk-1	No, based on the given context, it does not explicitly state that daf-16 directly interacts with sgk-1. Instead, it suggests that the regulatory mechanism involving lin29, mTORC2, and daf-16 occurs i
27401555	daf-16	sgk-1	No, based on the given context, while DAF-16 is involved in the increase of endogenous pqm1 gene expression in lin29 and daf-16 mutants, there is no direct indication that DAF-16 interacts with SGK-1
27401555	daf-16	sgk-1	No, DAF-16 depends on mutations for an increase in fat content, while mutation of SGK-1 leads to a decrease in fat. They seem to have an opposite effect on fat content in this context.
27401555	akt-1	sgk-1	Yes, in the given context it seems that akt-1 and sgk-1 can interact with each other, as individual disruption of both akt-1 and sgk-1 led to a reduction in vit gene expression. This indicates a rela

27871170	rcan-1	tax-6	In order to accurately answer this question, more specific details about the nature and functions of RCAN-1 and TAX-6 proteins are necessary. However, given just the provided genotype combination, it
27871170	rcan-1	tax-6	Yes, rcan-1 can interact with tax-6 because the given context mentions that rcan-1 has a significant effect on reversing the phenotype associated with low tax-6.
27871170	rcan-1	tax-6	No, I cannot directly infer whether rcan-1 and tax-6 can interact solely based on the provided context. The context only tells us that rcan-1 and tax-6 are being mentioned in relation to body lengths

28676648	lim-7	ceh-14	In the given context, it is suggested that there could be a possibility that LIMHD proteins lim-7 and ceh-14 may function together, as they share comparable roles with other similar proteins. However
28676648	lim-7	ceh-14	Based on the given context, it appears that "lim-7" and "ceh-14" are both being used in a biological study involving the expression of reporters in the head. Since both lim-7 and ceh-14 are being rep
28676648	lim-7	ceh-14	Yes, in this context, "lim-7" and "ceh-14" are mentioned together in the context of being expressed through micrographs as distinct reporters (GFP chIs513 for lim-7 and mCherry stIs10289 for ceh-14).
28676648	lim-7	ceh-14	The AI can's answer this question directly because it does not have specific information about the interaction between lim-7 and ceh-14. Based solely on the given context, which only states that the
