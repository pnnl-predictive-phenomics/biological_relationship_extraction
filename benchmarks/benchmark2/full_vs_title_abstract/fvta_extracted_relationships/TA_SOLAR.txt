139	22232551	tdp-1	HSF-1	"Yes (This answer is based on the given context, which suggests that there is some sort of relationship or interaction between tdp-1 and HSF-1, as the loss of tdp-1 has an effect on the defects in ani"
140	22232551	HSF-1	FOXO	"No, the context does not indicate an interaction between HSF-1 and FOXO, as it states that HSF-1 requires DAF16 (a type of transcriptional factor), while FOXO is not involved in life span extension."
141	22272187	piki-1	vps-34	"Yes (The context suggests that 'piki-1' and 'vps-34' likely interact or influence a process together, since inactivating both of them results in a common outcome - the complete abolishment of product"

156	23607404	dop-2	gpa-14	"No (However, it might imply a relation in terms of behavioral outcomes, but there's no direct evidence suggesting an interaction between dop-2 and gpa-14 in the given context.)"
157	23760267	fem-1	fem-3	"The context provided doesn't explicitly mention an interaction between fem-1 and fem-3. However, since fem-1, fem-2, and fem-3 all share a crucial role in male development, there could be the possibi"
