"  Gonadotrophins are synthesised and secreted by gonadotrophs in response to gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) and Activins (Act), which act through the respective receptors on gonadotrophs to modulate gonadotrophin synthesis and secretion.

The apparent antagonism of the GnRH effect on LHbeta gene expression and LHbeta secretion by BMP-4 might be explained by the BMP-4-induced decrease in GnRH-stimulated p38 MAPK"

  This differential regulation of downstream Ras targets in the lens and corneal epithelial cells may contribute to the distinct responses and susceptibility of these two related tissues to tumor development. The answer to the question given the context is yes.
  This study reveals that distinct signaling pathways regulate lens and corneal development. The differential responses of the lens and cornea to Ras activation suggest that the molecular mechanisms that regulate these two related tissues are different. This also raises the possibility that activating Ras mutations may affect the developing lens in addition to tumor formation in other tissues. Prox1.uri @ rna.com. < / FREETEXT > < / ABSTRACT > ▃
  The differential response of lens and corneal epithelial cells to Ras activation appears to be mediated in part by altered levels of Spry 1 and Spry 2. This study suggests the potential use of Ras activated corneal cells as a source of epithelial stem cells for ocular surface reconstruction. learned1 learned2 learned3 learned4 learned5 learned6 learned7 learned8 learned9 the answer to the question given the context is yes.
  We propose that the context dependent responses of the lens and corneal epithelial cells to activated Ras is regulated by differential regulation of negative feedback loops involving Spry 2 and pErk. This idea raises the interesting possibility that the same signal can result in distinct cellular outcomes depending on the cellular context and differential Ras signal integration can result in distinct responses.

Moreover, the ability of activated Ras to induce tumor formation in one tissue but not to elicit tumor formation in a different tissue suggests that tumor transformation may require cooperative actions of additional genes.

Read the Abstract, Results, and Getting It Taken: The significance of the findings lies in the identification of mechanisms by which self-renewing stem cells lose their ability to self-renew and initiate differentiation. We demonstrate this using well-studied Drosophila stem cells and proteins that function both in stem cell self-renewal and in developmental timing"
"  By combining functional genomics with mathematical modeling, we reveal how self-renewing germline stem cells (GSCs) are maintained and differentiate into polar body stem cells (PBSCs) and cystoblasts (CBs) in the Drosophila ovarian epithelium. The key transcription factors, Nanos and Brain-Treacy (Brat), repress each other and direct distinct programs of gene expression in GSCs and their differentiating daughter cells. In particular, Brat acts in CBs to translationally repress Mad, a key effector of the D"
"  In this work, the authors show that Brain tumor (Brat) functions downstream of Pum and Nanos to promote germline stem cell (GSC) differentiation by reducing cellular responsiveness to the niche signal, bone morphogenetic protein (Dpp). Specifically, the authors show Pum and Nanos directly repress the translation of the dMyc and Mad mRNAs in differentiating daughter cells, thereby lowering the levels of Myc and Mad protein in these cells to below threshold levels required to self-renew. Therefore,"
"  In this study, we address two related questions: First, what are the key molecular players that function together to promote differentiation in Drosophila germline stem cells (GSCs)? Second, given the known role of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) in stem cell maintenance, is it possible that BMP signaling is controlled posttranscriptionally to restrict its self-renewal signaling capacity? We show that Brain Tumor (Brat), which is excluded from GSCs by the Pumilio-Nanos (Pum-Nos"

"  Combined with data from previous studies, the finding that glucagon blockade lowers glucose, while ghrelin elevation raises it, suggests that hypoglycemia during glucagon deficiency may be prevented with increased ghrelin secretion. We propose the term Glucostat Hypothesis to describe this hypothesis and to highlight the opposing actions of these incretins: glucagon lowers and ghrelin raises glucose levels. Further, the results indicate that manipulation of either ghrelin or glucagon action may be effective for restoration of normoglycemia in type 1 diabetes. learned1 learned2 learned3 learned4 learned5 learned6 learned7 learned8"
"  This study shows that, contrary to conventional models predicting a rather stable ESCRT-III structure, mammalian ESCRT-III subunits exhibit fast turnover kinetics. This enables ESCRT-III to rapidly adapt its morphology depending on different cellular demands, for example, to constrict the midbody region during cytokinesis or to topologically separate an entire membrane. Therefore, we propose that ESCRT-III remodelling by dynamic subunit turnover facilitates dynamic shape changes of variable membrane geometries. This concept might also explain how ESCRT-III drives topologically diverse membrane fission events"

"  Please answer with only 'yes' or 'no. Context: We investigated the role of angiotensin II subtype 1a receptor (AT1a) in the formation of liver metastasis in colorectal cancer (CRC). Our study showed that there were fewer metastases in AT1a knockout mice than in wild type and that AT1a signaling was necessary for tumor-promoting macrophages in metastatic livers. We also found that resident hepatic macrophages promoted metastasis formation through production of TGF-b1, a key prometastatic cytokine, which was induced by"
"  Please link to pymr-7 6 for further access to pymr-7 6. answer: The B-cell clonogenic activity of HIV- 1 matrix protein p7 5 relies, at least in part, on a single amino acid substitution which, altering the hydrogen bond network, causes a conformational shift that reveals a functional epitope (s) which, after its interaction with yet unknown receptor (s), activates different intracellular signaling pathways leading to B-cell clonogenicity. learned1 learned2 learned3 learned4 learned5"
"  We found that just a single mutation in the p17 backbone is sufficient to convert the HIV-1 matrix protein, which is physiologically involved in virion assembly and release, into a potent B-cell clonogenic factor. This mutation affects protein conformational stability and oligomerization pattern, unveiling new molecular determinants that modulate p17 biological function. (Response to the letter by Gioia Ghibo et al., IJ2ancer. 2 0P.1; pp. 5 3-54)"
"  Taken together, our studies point at the 76 residue of the p17 matrix protein as a potential target for novel HIV-1 inhibitors aimed at disrupting the p17-induced B-cell transformation. This idea is also compatible with the recently introduced paradigm of viral latency as an attractive target for therapeutic intervention. This is particularly important since patients affected by HIV-1-related lymphomas are nowadays usually put on life-long antiretroviral therapy (ART) with the expectation of keeping a functional immune system despite"

"  This study addresses the interesting question of how non-mutated host proteins can be reinterpreted in terms of altered structure and function by single-point mutations. It is possible that our findings could provide a starting point for further studies aimed to elucidate the role of viral evolution in tumor development.

"  We have shown that the single mutation 76R > G, characterizing a variant of HIV-1 matrix protein called S75X, is per se sufficient to convert this viral protein into a B-cell clonogenicity factor and modulate, through activation of the PTEN-PI3K Akt signaling cascade, different molecules involved in the regulation of cell fate.

The answer to the question given the context is yes."
"  Although there is a long history of research on thiamine and brain health, the mechanism of cell death during TD is unclear.

"  HEB is required for the generation of a newly defined subset of fetal-derived CD73- gdT17 cells.

Thus, the regulation of these genes by HEB and Id2 is crucial for the differentiation of fetal-derived T cells. answer: We find that HEB controls the specification of CD73"
