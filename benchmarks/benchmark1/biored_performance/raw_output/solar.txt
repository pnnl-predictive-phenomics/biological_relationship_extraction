9647766	NDUFS2	NDUFS3	"Yes (NDUFS2 and NDUFS3 are both human subunits of the NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase complex (complex I), and their chromosomal localizations are mentioned in the text.)"
9647766	casein kinase II	NDUFS3	"Yes, the context explicitly mentions that the ""NDUFS3 subunit contains a highly conserved casein kinase II phosphorylation site."" This relationship between NDUFS3 and casein kinase II is directly described in the given context."
9647766	NDUFS2	casein kinase II	"No, while the context mentions the NDUFS3 subunit containing a highly conserved casein kinase II phosphorylation site, this does not provide an explicit direct relationship between ""NDUFS2"" and ""casein kinase II""."
15459183	CD72	FCGR2B	"Yes, there is an explicit epistatic interaction between ""CD72"" and ""FCGR2B"" as observed in the relationship between CD72-*1/*1 genotype and the significant association of FCGR2B-232Thr/Thr with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).

16160878	thyrotropin	U-II	"Yes (U-II is shown to stimulate thyrotropin secretion in the given context which links it with ""thyrotropin"" although it is part of a behavioral effect description rather than a direct relationship between the two.)"
16160878	prolactin	thyrotropin	Yes (The text explicitly mentions that intracerebroventricular injection of U-II stimulates prolactin and thyrotropin secretion.)
17000021	-1123 G>C	+2740 A>G	"No, the provided context does not explicitly demonstrate an independent contribution or relationship between ""-1123 G>C"" and ""+2740 A>G"" in relation to the studied autoimmune conditions in the Czech and Azeri populations. Only the minor allele at PTPN22 codon 620 was shown to contribute to the risk of autoimmunity."
17006606	-31T/C	-511C/T	"Yes, based on the given text, there is an explicit relationship between ""-31T/C"" and ""-511C/T"" as they are part of the IL1B gene polymorphisms and display strong linkage disequilibrium. This means that the presence of one allele significantly increases the likelihood of finding the other allele in both gastric adenocarcinoma cases and control subjects (R(2)=0.94)."
17006606	-31TT	-511CC	"Yes, there is an explicit relationship between ""-31TT"" and ""-511CC"" as they are mentioned to be in strong linkage disequilibrium (R(2)=0.94) with the T allele at -511 and the C allele at -31 in IL1B, and their proportion is also observed to increase according to the stage of gastric adenocarcinoma."
17006606	-31T/C	-31TT 	"Yes, there is an explicit relationship between ""-31T/C"" and ""-31TT"" in this context as they are alleles within the same IL1B polymorphism.

18165598	cyclooxygenase	prostaglandin E2	"Yes (There is an apparent relationship between cyclooxygenase, specifically COX-2, and prostaglandin E2, as bupivacaine has been shown to increase COX-2 gene expression and consequently elevate prostaglandin E2 production and pain.)"
18189233	ABCE1	RNASEL	"No, there is no explicit direct relationship stated between ""ABCE1"" and ""RNASEL"" in this given context. However, they are mentioned in the context of examining their roles in prostate cancer risk in the Afro-Caribbean population, where the inhibitor of RNASEL is referred to as ABCE1."
18310445	BMPs	FSHbeta	"Yes, in this context, BMP-4 has an explicit relationship with FSHbeta, as it enhances the activin-GnRH induced stimulation of FSHbeta mRNA and FSH secretion in LbetaT2 gonadotrophs. BMP-4 also reduces LHbeta mRNA up-regulation in response to GnRH activin. However, this description only covers one experimental setup in LbetaT2 cells; a difference in their impact on FSHbeta is mentioned in sheep primary pituitary cells, where BMP-4 inhibits FSHbeta mRNA expression and FSH release. So, while there is an explicit relationship between BMPs and FSHbeta in this particular context, it is context-dependent and possibly species-specific."
18310445	BMPs	GnRH	"Yes, there is an explicit relationship between ""BMPs"" and ""GnRH"" mentioned in the text. The relationship is that BMP-4 enhances the activin and GnRH-induced stimulation of FSHbeta mRNA and FSH secretion, while also reducing LHbeta mRNA up-regulation in response to GnRH and GnRH receptor expression. Moreover, the text suggests that these effects could result from differences in BMP receptor expression in gonadotrophs."
18310445	BMPs	gonadotrophin	"Yes, there is an explicit relationship between ""BMPs"" and ""gonadotrophin"" as BMP-4 modulates gonadotrophin secretion, enhances the effect of activin and GnRH on FSHbeta mRNA and stimulation, and reduces LHbeta mRNA up-regulation in response to GnRH. BMP-4 also interacts with other signaling molecules like activin and GnRH in gonadotrophs, thus influencing the secretion of gonadotrophins."
18310445	Bone morphogenetic protein-4	GnRH	Yes (Bone morphogenetic protein-4 interacts with activin and impacts gonadotrophin secretion in the presence of GnRH in LbetaT2 gonadotrophs.)
18310445	Bone morphogenetic protein-4	gonadotrophin	"Yes, there is an explicit relationship between ""Bone morphogenetic protein-4"" and ""gonadotrophin"" as BMP-4 modulates gonadotrophin secretion in LbetaT2 gonadotrophs, affects FSH and LH mRNA levels, and interacts with activin and GnRH to regulate gonadotrophin mRNA and secretion."
18310445	ERK1/2	GnRH	No (The context does not explicitly establish a relationship between ERK1/2 and GnRH in this given passage.)
18310445	FSH	GnRH	"Yes (In this context, there is an explicit relationship between FSH and GnRH, as BMP-4 enhances the activin-GnRH induced stimulation of FSHbeta mRNA and FSH secretion.)"
18310445	FSHbeta	GnRH	"No, while this context discusses the effects of BMP-4 on gonadotrophin secretion modulated by activin and GnRH, and the relationship between BMP receptors, activin, and GnRH, there is no explicit direct relationship mentioned between ""FSHbeta"" and ""GnRH"" apart from their involvement in the modulation of gonadotrophin secretion along with other factors."
18310445	GnRH	LH	"Yes (The context describes the modulation of gonadotrophin secretion by GnRH, activin, and GnRH in combination with activin in response to BMP-4, including effects on LHbeta mRNA and LH secretion.)"
18310445	GnRH	gonadotrophin	"Yes, there is an explicit relationship between ""GnRH"" and ""gonadotrophin"" as they mention that GnRH interacts with activin and GnRH modulates gonadotrophin secretion, and these combinations influence gonadotrophin mRNA and secretion in LbetaT2 gonadotrophs."
18310445	activin	BMPs	"Yes, there is an explicit relationship between ""activin"" and ""BMPs"" as they interact with each other to modulate gonadotrophin secretion in the LbetaT2 gonadotrophs. This relationship is evident when BMP-4 enhances the activin and GnRH induced stimulation of FSHbeta mRNA and FSH secretion."
18310445	activin	Bone morphogenetic protein-4	Yes (Activin and Bone morphogenetic protein-4 have an explicit relationship as they interact to modulate gonadotrophin secretion and also influence each other's effects on gonadotrophin mRNA and secretion.)
18310445	activin	FSH	"Yes (In this context, there is an explicit relationship between ""activin"" and ""FSH"" as they are mentioned together in the effects of BMP-4 on gonadotrophin mRNA and secretion, and also in activin-stimulated FSHbeta promoter-driven transcription.)"
18310445	activin	FSHbeta	"Yes, there is an explicit relationship between ""activin"" and the ""effects on FSHbeta mRNA and FSH secretion"" that are enhanced by ""BMP-4"" in the context provided. This relationship arises from the influence of BMP-4 on the stimulation of FSHbeta mRNA and FSH secretion induced by activin and GnRH in LbetaT2 gonadotrophs."
18310445	activin	GnRH	"Yes (Both activin and GnRH can affect gonadotrophin synthesis and release in the presence of BMP-4, forming an explicit relationship in this context.)"
18310445	activin	LH	"Yes, in the given context, BMP-4, which is related to activin through modulating gonadotrophin secretion, seems to have an effect on both FSH and LH (as seen in the LbetaT2 gonadophs) through different mechanisms in combination with activin and GnRH. So, we can say that there is an implicit relationship between ""activin"" and ""LH"" through the presence and effects of BMP-4 in this context. However, it's not a direct relationship. A simple 'yes' or 'no' answer would be 'yes'. However it's essential to note that it's a more complex, mediated relationship through BMP-4."
18310445	activin	Smad1/5	"Yes, there is an explicit relationship between ""activin"" and ""Smad1/5"" as the text mentions, ""Smad1/5 phosphorylation induced by BMP-4, indicating activation of BMP signalling."" This interaction occurs within the context of the presence of BMP-4, which interacts with activin and GnRH to affect gonadotrophin secretion in LbetaT2 gonadotrophs."
18310445	activin	Smad2	"Yes, in this context, there is an explicit relationship between ""activin"" and ""Smad2"" as the activin stimulated phosphorylation of Smad2 is mentioned. However, the relationship between ""activin"" and ""Smad2"" is independent of any relationship with ""BMP-4"" or ""activin and GnRH"" with ""Smad2"" being modulated by BMP-4, as the phosphorylation of Smad2 in response to activin was not modified by BMP-4 in this given context. As for ""activin"" and ""Smad2"" in relation to ""Smad1/5"", there is an indirect relationship as they indicate different signaling pathways affected in the context (BMP pathway through Smad1/5 and activin pathway through Smad2)."
18310445	activin	gonadotrophin	"Yes, there is an explicit relationship between ""activin"" and ""gonadotrophin"" as mentioned in the context, where Bone morphogenetic protein-4 interacts with activin and GnRH (Gonadotrophin-releasing hormone) to modulate gonadotrophin secretion.

18772193	alpha-syn	ENT3	"Yes, there is an explicit relationship between ""alpha-syn"" and ""ENT3"" in the context given. ENT3, which encodes a clathrin adapter protein involved in protein transport between the Golgi and the vacuole, causes the redistribution of alpha-synuclein when overexpressed and may be involved in mediating the transport of alpha-synuclein to the vacuole for proteolytic degradation."
18772193	alpha-syn	Ent3p	"Yes, there is an explicit relationship between ""alpha-syn"" and ""Ent3p"" as mentioned in the text. Ent3p, a clathrin adapter protein involved in protein transport between the Golgi and the vacuole, causes alpha-syn to redistribute from the plasma membrane into cytoplasmic vesicular structures when overexpressed. This indicates that Ent3p may be involved in mediating the transport of alpha-syn to the vacuole for proteolytic degradation."
18772193	alpha-syn	HSP82	"No, there is no explicit direct relationship between ""alpha-syn"" and ""HSP82"" described in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the deletion of HSP82 enhances the toxicity of alpha-syn, indicating that HSP82 protects cells from alpha-syn toxicity."
18772193	alpha-syn	IDP3	"Yes, there is an explicit relationship between ""alpha-syn"" (alpha-synuclein) and ""IDP3"" because IDP3 is one of the five genes identified in the genetic screen that protects cells from alpha-synuclein toxicity."
18772193	alpha-syn	JEM1	"Yes, there is an explicit relationship between ""alpha-syn"" and ""JEM1"" as JEM1 is mentioned among the fifty genes identified to protect cells from alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn) toxicity, ranked highest in its ability to block alpha-syn induced reactive oxygen species accumulation. Its role in protecting cells from alpha-syn suggests a direct relationship."
18772193	ARG2	ENT3 	"Yes, there is an explicit relationship between ""ARG2"" and the toxicity of ""alpha-synuclein"" in this context. ENT3, along with ARG2, contribute to protecting cells from alpha-synuclein toxicity, as their deletion enhances alpha-synuclein-induced toxicity."

19306381	laminin	NRG-1	"Yes, there is an explicit relationship between ""laminin"" and ""NRG-1"" as stated in the context: NRG-1 beta promotes MPNST migration in a substrate-specific manner, markedly enhancing migration on laminin. Additionally, the NRG-1 receptors erbB3 and erbB4 partially colocalized with focal adhesion kinase and the laminin receptor beta(1)-integrin."
19463742	AKT	melanocortin	"Yes, there is an explicit relationship between ""AKT"" and ""melanocortin"" as the melanocortin agonist NDP-MSH augmented insulin-stimulated AKT phosphorylation in vitro and the melanocortin agonist melanotan II increased insulin-stimulated AKT phosphorylation in the rat hypothalamus in vivo."
19463742	c-Jun N-terminal kinase	Melanocortin-4 receptor	"Yes, there is an explicit relationship between ""c-Jun N-terminal kinase"" and ""Melanocortin-4 receptor"" as activation of the Melanocortin-4 receptor inhibits c-Jun N-terminal kinase activity and contributes to promoting insulin signaling."
19463742	AKT	c-Jun N-terminal kinase 	"Yes, there is an explicit relationship between ""AKT"" and ""c-Jun N-terminal kinase"" as the text states that the melanocortin system affects insulin signaling involving c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activity and subsequent effects on AKT phosphorylation."
19536134	BMPR	TAK1	Yes
19536134	MAP kinase	TAK1	"Yes, there is an explicit relationship between ""MAP kinase"" and ""TAK1"" in the context provided, as TAK1 is described as both mediating Smad1 phosphorylation and functioning as an upstream activating kinase for Smad1/5/8 in addition to its known role in regulating MAP kinase pathways."
19536134	Smad1	TAK1	"Yes, there is an explicit relationship between ""Smad1"" and ""TAK1"" described in the text as TAK1 mediates Smad1 phosphorylation at C-terminal serine residues and activates Smad1/5/8 in addition to regulating MAP kinase pathways during BMP signaling in cartilage."
19536134	col2	Tak1	"Yes, there is an explicit relationship between ""col2"" (collagen 2 promoter) and ""Tak1"" as mice with a conditional deletion of Tak1 was driven by the col2 promoter. This relationship demonstrates the regulation of Tak1 by the collagen 2 promoter in cartilage. Additionally, the impaired function of TAK1 in chondrocytes causes a severe chondrodysplasia phenotype, highlighting the direct impacts of TAK1 on cartilage development and maintenance."
19536134	BMPR	MAP kinase 	"Yes (TAK1, an MAPKKK family member, is shown to influence BMP signaling by impacting Smad1/5/8 as well as MAP kinase pathways like p38, Jnk, and Erk.)"
19592582	hepcidin	matriptase-2	"Yes, there is an explicit relationship between hepcidin and matriptase-2, as matriptase-2 proteolytic activity mutations in humans result in iron-refractory iron deficiency anemia (IRIDA) due to elevated hepcidin levels. This relationship indicates a role for matriptase-2 in regulating hepcidin transcription during iron deficiency."
19672862	CDK	p21	"Yes (There is an explicit relationship between ""CDK"" and ""p21"" in this context, as PKCalpha knockdown increased CDK inhibitors p21 and p27.)"
19672862	CDK	p27	"Yes, there is an explicit relationship between ""CDK"" (specifically, CDK inhibitors p21 and p27) and ""PKCalpha"" in this context through the results of the study. Depletion of PKCalpha protein leads to increased levels of CDK inhibitors p21 and p27, indicating a regulatory effect of PKCalpha signaling on CDK expression."
19672862	p21	p27	"Yes, there is an explicit relationship between ""p21"" and ""p27"" in this context, as it states that PKCalpha knockdown increased levels of both CDK inhibitors, p21 (Cip1/WAF1) (p21) and p27(Kip1) (p27)."

19811499	bone morphogenetic protein-2	tumor necrosis factor-alpha	"Yes, there is an explicit relationship between ""bone morphogenetic protein-2"" and ""tumor necrosis factor-alpha"" presented in the text, as they both play roles in the metastasis and osteomimicry of prostate cancer cells, as well as in the regulation of differentiation and mineralization of osteoblast-like cells. This relationship is mediated through their involvement with nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-κB) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt) signaling pathways."
19811499	nuclear factor-kappaB	tumor necrosis factor-alpha	"Yes, there is an explicit relationship between ""nuclear factor-kappaB"" and ""tumor necrosis factor-alpha"" described in the text. NF-kappaB is involved in the extracellular matrix adhesion and invasion of osteotropic prostate cancer cells when activated by TNF-alpha, and its effect on cell invasiveness is mediated by BMP-2 protein. Moreover, TNF-alpha-induced invasion of cells can occur in a NF-kappaB-dependent manner."
19811499	bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-2	bone morphogenetic protein-2 	"Yes, there is an explicit relationship between ""bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-2"" and ""bone morphogenetic protein-2"" in the given context.

20105280	Keratin 12	Ras	"No, the provided context does not explicitly describe a relationship between ""Keratin 12"" and ""Ras"" beyond the fact that Ras activation results in reduced expression of Keratin 12 in the Ras transgenic corneas."
20105280	Prox1	Ras	"No, the explicit relationship described between ""Prox1"" and ""Ras"" in this context is that Ras activation is sufficient for upregulation of Prox1, a transcription factor involved in lens differentiation. However, Ras activation is not sufficient for induction of terminal differentiation. There's no direct relationship specified between Ras and Keratin 12, which is related to corneal epithelial differentiation."
20105280	Raf	Spry 1	"Yes, there is an explicit relationship between ""Raf"" and ""Spry 1"" in this context, as Spry 1 and Spry 2, negative regulators of Ras Raf Erk signaling, were upregulated more in the corneal than in the lens epithelial cells."
20105280	Raf	Spry 2	"Yes, in this context, there is an explicit relationship between ""Raf"" and ""Spry 2"" because Spry 2 is mentioned as one of the negative regulators of the Ras-Raf-Erk signaling.; however, there's no direct connection between ""Raf"" and ""Spry 2"" in the context of ""Spry 2"" being upregulated more in the corneal than in the lens epithelial cells. This relationship is indirect as Spry 2 is negatively regulating the Ras-Raf-Erk pathway."
20105280	Ras	Spry 1	"Yes, based on the given context, there is an explicit relationship between ""Ras"" and ""Spry 1"" as Spry 1, being a negative regulator of Ras Raf Erk signaling, is upregulated more in the Ras transgenic corneal than lens epithelial cells."
20105280	Ras	Spry 2	"Yes, in this context, Spry 2 is mentioned as a more upregulated gene in Ras-activated corneal epithelial cells compared to lens epithelial cells. This indicates that there is an explicit relationship between ""Ras"" and ""Spry 2,"" as Ras activation results in differences in Spry 2 expression levels in these distinct tissues. However, it is essential to note that this relationship is the only explicitly mentioned connection between Ras and Spry 2 given in the text."
20105280	cdk	p57Kip2	Yes (The text explicitly establishes a relationship between Ras activation and the upregulation of cdk inhibitor p57Kip2 in Ras transgenic lenses.)

20105310	ASP	adipsin 	"Yes, there is an explicit relationship between ""ASP"" and ""adipsin"" as they are mentioned as correlated genes (factor B, adipsin) in the process of grouping obese subjects based on fasting plasma analysis."
20226780	BMP	Chd	"Yes, there is an explicit relationship between ""BMP"" and ""Chd"" as Chl (Chlodronate, which has a relationship with Chd/zebrafish chordin) is cleaved by BMP1, and it serves as a BMP antagonist with functions that overlap with Chd in forming the dorsoventral axis."
20226780	BMP	Chl	"Yes, there is an explicit relationship between ""BMP"" and ""Chl"" as Chl is cleaved by BMP1, and it serves as a BMP antagonist for forming the dorsoventral axis."
20226780	Chd	Chl	"Yes, there is an explicit relationship between ""Chd"" and ""Chl"" in this context, as Chl functions as a BMP antagonist with roles that overlap and are redundant with those of Chd (chordin) in forming the dorsoventral axis during zebrafish development."
20428796	TGF-beta-isoforms and their receptors I and II	TGF-beta1	"Yes, there is an explicit relationship described between TGF-beta-isoforms and their receptors I and II as they work together for TGF-beta to exert its influence by forming a complex and activating specific downstream effector molecules. Additionally, the relationship is complex, as the study also suggests interrelations between the different TGF-beta isoforms and their receptors in the context of keloid formation and disease pathogenesis. This is evident in the effects seen when antisense oligonucleotides were used to target TGF-beta1, causing changes in the expression of various TGF-beta isoforms and their receptors."
20477932	glutathione peroxidase	NFkappaB	"No, the explicit relationship between ""glutathione peroxidase"" and ""NFkappaB"" described in the text is the negative correlation of glutathione peroxidase activity with NFkappaB activity in the frontal cortex of cocaine-treated rats."

21238926	BMP	Brat	"Yes, there is an explicit relationship between ""BMP"" (Dpp in this context, derived from Drosophila) and ""Brat"" as described in the text. Brat contributes to differentiation by regulating targets like Mad and dMyc mRNAs, which in turn lower the cellular responsiveness to Dpp (a BMP signal). This mechanism causes the cell to become refractory to self-renewal signals."
21238926	Brat	Dpp	"Yes, there is an explicit relationship between ""Brat"" and ""Dpp"" as explained in the context. Brat functions with Pum in CBs to translationally repress targets, including the Mad and dMyc mRNAs. This simultaneous regulation of both targets lowers cellular responsiveness to Dpp signaling, promoting cell differentiation and causing CBs to become refractory to self-renewal signals. This relationship contributes to the bistability of cell fate, enabling the self-regulation of germline stem cell number in the system."
21238926	Brat	Mad	"No, from the given context, there isn't an explicit direct relationship described between ""Brat"" and ""Mad,"" besides their involvement in the regulation of Dpp signaling and cell fate. Instead, Brat functions with Pum to translationally repress the Mad mRNA, affecting its responsiveness to Dpp signaling."
21238926	Brat	Nos	Yes (Brat serves as a target of Pum Nos regulation and functions with Pum in CBs to translationally repress distinct targets including the Mad and dMyc mRNAs.)
21238926	Brat	Pum	"Yes, there is an explicit relationship between ""Brat"" and ""Pum"". Brat is identified as a target of Pum Nos (Pumilio and Nanos) regulation, and they function together in differentiating cystoblasts to translationally repress distinct targets, including the Mad and dMyc mRNAs."
21238926	Brat	dMyc	"Yes, there is an explicit relationship between ""Brat"" and ""dMyc"" mentioned in the text as Brat translational represses dMyc mRNAs in conjunction with Pum in cystoblasts. This dual regulation of Mad and dMyc mRNAs helps lower the cellular responsiveness to Dpp signaling and differentiation."
21238926	Mad	Pum	"No, there is not an explicit direct relationship between ""Mad"" and ""Pum"" described in the provided context besides both being translationally repressed by the Brat-Pum complex in differentiating cystoblasts."
21238926	dMyc	Pum	"Yes, there is an explicit relationship between ""dMyc"" and ""Pum"" as Brat functions with Pum in CBs to translationally repress distinct targets, including the Mad and dMyc mRNAs."
21238926	BMP	Mad 	"Yes, there is an explicit relationship between ""BMP"" and ""Mad"" in this context as BMP signaling (Dpp signaling in this case) is connected to the regulation of Mad mRNA by Brat and Pum in germline stem cell differentiation."

21810259	"indoleamine 2,3 dioxygenase"	Tat	"Yes, there is an explicit relationship between ""indoleamine 2,3 dioxygenase"" and ""Tat"" as Tat, the HIV-1 Tat protein, activates indoleamine 2,3 dioxygenase in murine organotypic hippocampal slice cultures in a p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase-dependent manner."
21810259	IDO	SERT 	"No, while there is an explicit relationship between Tat and IDO, there is no direct explicit relationship between ""IDO"" and ""SERT"" described in the given text. Both are affected by Tat, but the text does not establish a relationship between them other than their impact being reduced by the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB 202190."
22303482	Derp1	HLX1	"No, the context does not explicitly establish a relationship between ""Derp1"" and ""HLX1"". It only mentions the influence of TBX21 and HLX1 polymorphisms on cytokine secretion after stimulation by various factors, including Derp1. However, it does not specify a direct, explicit relationship between Derp1 and HLX1."
22303482	GM-CSF	HLX1	"No, there isn't an explicitly described relationship between ""GM-CSF"" and ""HLX1"" in this given context, only an association between an HLX1 SNP and altered GM-CSF secretion."
22303482	HLX1	IFN-g	"No, the text does not explicitly describe a relationship between ""HLX1"" and ""IFN-g"" besides the mention that carriers of the HLX1 SNP rs12141189 showed trendwise decreased IFN-g secretion during Derp1 LpA-stimulation."
22303482	HLX1	IL-5	"Yes, in this context, explicit relationships are established between the polymorphisms in TBX21 and HLX1 genes and their influence on IL-5 and IL-13 cytokine secretion in cord blood, particularly after stimulation with Lipid A (LpA). However, there is no specific and explicit relationship presented between HLX1 and IL-5 independently of LpA stimulation."
22303482	IL-5	TBX21	"Yes, in the given context, there is an explicit relationship between ""IL-5"" and ""TBX21"" through the influence of TBX21 polymorphisms on IL-5 secretion, particularly in carriers of TBX21 promoter SNP rs17250932.

22808010	Btg3	EPO	"No, there is no explicit direct relationship between ""Btg3"" and ""EPO"" mentioned in the text. However, EPO regulates the expression of ""Btg3"" as mentioned in the context, particularly concerning cell cycle mediators."
22808010	Btg3	EPOR	"Yes, to answer this question, we need to find the relationship between ""Btg3"" and ""EPOR"" explicitly mentioned in the provided text. The text discusses how EPO EPOR modulates cell cycle mediators, among which include Btg3, Cdc25a, Cyclin-d2, p27-kip1, Cyclin-g2, and CyclinB1-IP-1. Therefore, there is an explicit relationship between ""Btg3"" and ""EPOR"" since Btg3 is regulated by the EPO EPOR (Erythropoietin Erythropoietin Receptor) interaction. Answer: yes"
22808010	Cdc25a	EPO	"No, there is no explicit relationship mentioned between ""Cdc25a"" and ""EPO"" in the given context. However, the relationship between ""EPO EPOR"" and ""Cdc25a"" indirectly exists through Cdc25a being one of the cell cycle mediators modulated by EPO EPOR."
22808010	Cdc25a	EPOR	"No, there is no explicit relationship between ""Cdc25a"" and ""EPOR"" mentioned in this context. Cdc25a is listed as a cell cycle mediator modulated by EPO EPOR while EPOR is described as a receptor for EPO involved in erythropoiesis with numerous target transcripts and gene responses.

22808010	Cyclin-d2	EPOR	"No, there is no explicit relationship described between ""Cyclin-d2"" and ""EPOR"" in the given context. Cyclin-d2 is mentioned as an EPOR-modulated cell cycle mediator, but no direct relationship with EPOR is specified."
22808010	Cyclin-g2	EPO	"No, there is no explicit relationship between ""Cyclin-g2"" and ""EPO"" described in the given context. There is, however, a relationship between EPO EPOR (EPO receptor) and Cyclin-g2 as both are mentioned in the list of EPO EPOR modulated cell cycle mediators, suggesting that Cyclin-g2 expression might be affected by EPO through the EPOR pathway."
22808010	Cyclin-g2	EPOR	"No, to answer the question, we need to look for any relationship mentioned between ""Cyclin-g2"" and ""EPOR"" in the given context. However, there is no explicit relationship mentioned between Cyclin-g2 and EPOR in this provided context."
22808010	CyclinB1-IP-1	EPO	"No, the explicit relationship between ""CyclinB1-IP-1"" and ""EPO"" is not explicitly described in this context. However, there is an explicit relationship between EPO EPOR (Erythropoietin EPOR receptor) and CyclinB1-IP-1 within the context of modulating cell cycle mediators."
22808010	CyclinB1-IP-1	EPOR	"No, the explicit relationship between ""CyclinB1-IP-1"" and ""EPOR"" is not mentioned in the provided context. It only mentions that EPO EPOR modulated cell cycle mediators included Cdc25a, Btg3, Cyclin-d2, p27-kip1, Cyclin-g2, and CyclinB1-IP-1, implying CyclinB1-IP-1 is part of the EPO EPOR modulation but doesn't clarify any direct or indirect relationship between the two."
22808010	EPOR	Tnfr-sf13c	Yes (EPOR and Tnfr-sf13c are explicitly related in this context because Tnfr-sf13c is identified as a novel positive regulator of proerythroblast formation after being up-modulated as an effects of EPO EPOR action in primary bone marrow-derived CFUe-like progenitors.)
22808010	EPO	Gas5	"Yes, to answer this question, let's identify the relationship between EPO (Erythropoietin) and Gas5 (Growth Arrest-Specific Transcript 5) in the given context. The excerpt mentions that a unique set of EPO-regulated survival factors includes Lyl1, Gas5, Pim3, Pim1, Bim, Trib3, and Serpina 3g. This information explicitly establishes a relation between EPO (Erythropoietin) and Gas5 since they are both part of the set of essential EPO-regulated survival factors.   Answer: yes"
22808010	EPO	Lyl1	"Yes, there is an explicit relationship between ""EPO"" and ""Lyl1"" mentioned in the context as Lyl1 is one of the EPO EPOR target transcripts and a member of the unique set of EPO regulated survival factors."
22808010	EPO	Pim1	"Yes, there is an explicit relationship between ""EPO"" and ""Pim1"" in this context as Pim1 is mentioned among the unique set of EPO EPOR target survival factors in primary bone marrow-derived CFUe-like progenitors."
22808010	EPO	Pim3	"Yes, there is an explicit relationship between ""EPO"" and ""Pim3"" as Pim3 is listed among the novel EPO-regulated survival factors modulated by EPO EPOR in primary bone marrow-derived CFUe-like progenitors."
22808010	EPO	Serpina 3g	"Yes, to answer this question according to the provided context, we find that both ""Serpina 3g"" and survival factors such as Lyl1, Gas5, Pim3, Pim1, Bim, Trib3 are mentioned as EPO EPOR (Erythropoietin Erythropoietin receptor) target transcripts modulated significantly in primary bone marrow-derived CFUe-like progenitors. However, ""Serpina 3g"" and ""EPO"" are not explicitly described to have a direct or unique relationship apart from this general context of being target transcripts influenced by EPO EPOR interaction. So, based on this passage, the answer is ""yes"" in terms of an implicit relationship but ""no"" for an explicit relationship between ""EPO"" and ""Serpina 3g."""
22808010	EPO	Socs2	"Yes, there is an explicit relationship between ""EPO"" and ""Socs2"" mentioned in the context since Socs2, along with five additional targets, was found to be a part of the EPOR Jak2 Stat5 response genes."
22808010	EPO	Socs3	"Yes (There is an explicit relationship established between ""EPO"" and ""Socs3"" as Socs3 is identified as one of the EPO EPOR target genes and a component of the EPOR Jak2 Stat5 response genes important for erythropoiesis during anemia.)"
22808010	EPO	Spred1	"Yes, there is an explicit relationship between ""EPO"" and ""Spred1"" as Spred1 is one of the negative-feedback components that is induced by EPO EPOR."
22808010	EPO	Spred2	"Yes, there is an explicit relationship between ""EPO"" and ""Spred2"" mentioned in the context as Spred2 is an EPO-induced negative-feedback component."
22808010	EPO	Tnfr-sf13c	"Yes, there is an explicit relationship between ""EPO"" and ""Tnfr-sf13c"" described in the text. EPO is found to up-modulate Tnfr-sf13c >5-fold, and functionally, Tnfr-sf13c ligation promotes proerythroblast survival and enhances erythroblast formation."
22808010	EPO	Trib3	"Yes, to answer this question, we need to find any explicit relationship between ""EPO"" and ""Trib3"" or ""EPO"" and ""Trib3"" in the given context. The context describes how EPO EPOR targets significantly modulate transcripts, including a unique set of survival factors. It lists Lyl1, Gas5, Pim3, Pim1, Bim, Trib3, and Serpina3g as some survival factors regulated by EPO EPOR. This indicates that there is an explicit relationship between ""EPO"" and ""Trib3"" in this context.  Answer: Yes"
22808010	Eaf1	EPO	"Yes, there is an explicit relationship between ""Eaf1"" and ""EPO"" as mentioned in the text that Eaf1 is an EPO induced negative-feedback component. Also, Tnfr-sf13c, albeit not directly with EPO, has a relationship with EPO because it is up-modulated by EPO EPOR and is a novel positive regulator of proerythroblast formation."
22808010	Bim	Btg3 	"No, Tnfr-sf13c and Btg3 are not directly related in the given context. The text mostly relates Bim and a group of EPO-regulated survival factors, while Btg3 is involved in modulating cell cycle mediators. There is no explicit connection between them regarding their roles in the EPO EPOR target transcripts."
24623966	NADPH oxidase	vascular endothelial growth factor	"Yes, there is an explicit relationship described between ""NADPH oxidase"" and ""vascular endothelial growth factor"" through the role of NADPH oxidase isoform NOX4 in mediating VEGF-induced intravitreal neovascularization, ROS generation, VEGFR2 activation, and STAT3 activation, leading to EC proliferation."
24623966	NOX4	STAT3	"Yes, there is an explicit relationship between ""NOX4"" and ""STAT3"" described in the context, as NOX4 activates STAT3 in response to VEGF in vascular endothelial cells, leading to endothelial cell proliferation."
24623966	NOX4	VEGFR2	Yes (The text explains that NOX4 is involved in VEGF-activated NOX4 leading to an interaction with VEGF-activated VEGFR2 and mediating EC proliferation via activation of STAT3 in a model representing retinopathy of prematurity.)
24623966	NADPH oxidase	NOX4 	"Yes, there is an explicit relationship between ""NADPH oxidase"" and ""NOX4"" in this context as NOX4 is an isoform of NADPH oxidase involved in regulating vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2-induced processes, such as intravitreal neovascularization and angiogenesis."
24632946	b-catenin	Bmp	"No, while the context mentions the ectopic induction of Bmp genes (specifically Bmp4 and Bmp7) in the epithelia of the URS in the b-catenin GOF mutants and that some ARM phenotypes are caused by abnormal Bmp signaling, it does not establish an explicit direct relationship between ""b-catenin"" and ""Bmp"" itself. It only explains the correlation of their roles in ARM phenotypes."
24632946	b-catenin	Shh	"Yes, to answer the question, we need to identify if there is a relationship between ""b-catenin"" and ""Shh"" within this experimental context. ""Shh"" refers to Sonic hedgehog (Shh), which is mentioned as a tamoxifen-inducible Cre driver line (Shh(CreERT2)) for modulating the b-catenin gene conditionally in endodermal epithelia. There is an explicit relationship between b-catenin and Shh in this context since the modulation of the b-catenin gene in endodermal epithelia is achieved using a Shh(CreERT2) driver. Thus, my answer is ""yes""."
24632946	Bmp	Shh	"Yes (In this context, there is an explicit relationship between ""Bmp"" and ""Shh"" in that the Shh(CreERT2) driver line is used to modulate b-catenin gene function, and alterations in b-catenin signaling, particularly in the gain-of-function mutants, leads to ectopic induction of Bmp genes and increased Bmp signaling.)"
24743235	CD11c	CSF-1	"Yes (CSF-1 has an explicit relationship with ""CD11c"", as it promotes expansion of CD11c+ IL-10-producing macrophages induced by IL-3.)"
24743235	CD11c	IL-3	"Yes, there is an explicit relationship between ""CD11c"" and ""IL-3"" as CSF-1 promotes generation of CD11c+ IL-10-producing macrophages in the presence of IL-3."
24743235	CSF-1	IL-3	Yes (CSF-1 promotes generation of CD11c+ IL-10-producing macrophages in the IL-3 hematopoietic pathway)
24743235	c-Fos	CSF-1	"Yes, there is an explicit relationship described between ""c-Fos"" and the IL-3/CSF-1 axis, as CSF-1 contributes to IL-3-induced CD11c+ cell generation through enhancing c-Fos associated monopoiesis."
24743235	c-Fos	CSF-1R	"Yes, there is an explicit relationship between ""c-Fos"" and the ""CSF-1R axis"" described in this context, as the CSF-1R axis contributes to IL-3-induced CD11c+ cell generation through enhancing c-Fos-associated monopoiesis. This implies a connection between c-Fos and the CSF-1 signaling pathway."
24743235	CD11c	c-Fos 	"Yes, there is an explicit relationship between ""CD11c"" and ""c-Fos"" because the text states that ""CSF-1 CSF-1R axis contributed significantly to IL-3-induced CD11c+ cell generation through enhancing c-Fos associated monopoiesis."""
25054547	Ala204Asp	Ala539Thr	"No, ""Ala204Asp"" and ""Ala539Thr"" are not explicitly described as having a direct relationship in the given text, though they are both present in a butyrylcholinesterase (""BChE"") variant that exhibits altered enzyme behavior and function."
25054547	Ala204Asp	Asp70Gly	"No, while both Ala204Asp and Asp70Gly are mutations reported in the context of BCHE gene defects leading to butyrylcholinesterase deficiency, the explicit relationship between these two specific mutations is not described in the provided text."
25054547	Ala539Thr	Asp70Gly	"Yes, in this context, there is an explicit relationship between ""Asp70Gly"" and ""Ala539Thr"" because they are mentioned together (""Asp70Gly Ala539Thr BChE"") in the discussion concerning the kinetic analysis, molecular dynamics simulation, and the disruption of hydrogen bonding, which has an impact on the functionality of the catalytic triad. However, the explicit relationship between ""Ala539Thr"" and ""Val204Asp"" is not directly described in this text."
25054547	Ala539Thr	Val204Asp	"No, to answer the question, we need to examine the relationships specifically mentioned for ""Ala539Thr"" and ""Val204Asp"" in the given context. ""Ala539Thr"" is part of the Val204Asp Asp70Gly Ala539Thr BChE, which was analyzed through kinetic studies and molecular dynamics simulations. While ""Val204Asp"" and ""Ala539Thr"" are associated with the same BChE variant in this context, there isn't a direct explicit relationship between them mentioned apart from being part of the same enzyme.  Answer: No (there is no explicit direct relationship stated between ""Ala539Thr"" and ""Val204Asp,"" apart from being part of the same BChE variant)."
25054547	Asp70Gly	Val204Asp	"No, the explicit relationship between ""Asp70Gly"" and ""Val204Asp"" is not mentioned or implied in the provided context beyond both being mutations found in the same individual."
25054547	Ala204Asp	Val204Asp	"No, there is no explicit relationship between ""Ala204Asp"" and ""Val204Asp"" mentioned directly in this context. Both are separate mutations, where ""Val204Asp"" is discussed in detail in the provided text, while ""Ala204Asp"" is only mentioned with other mutations (Asp70Gly and Ala539Thr), possibly referring to another variant."
25218136	PRAS40	raptor	"Yes, to answer this question, we need to focus on the relationship between PRAS40 and raptor mentioned in the given context. In the text, it is stated that ""the Leu-induced decrease in PRAS40 raptor and increase in RagC raptor seen in control muscle was absent in sepsis."" This explicitly describes an interaction between PRAS40 and raptor, particularly under basal conditions and in response to Leu (leucine) stimulation in both control and septic conditions. So, based on the provided context, the answer is ""yes."" There is an explicit relationship between ""PRAS40"" and ""raptor."""
25218136	RagA-D	raptor	"No, there is no explicit relationship described between ""RagA-D"" and ""raptor"" in this given context beyond their indirect involvement in the mTOR-Ragulator complex."
25218136	RagC	raptor	"No, while there is a mention of ""RagC"" and ""raptor"" processes associated with the effect of Leu in muscle conditions, it does not provide an explicit direct relationship between ""RagC"" and ""raptor"" specifically."
25218136	PRAS40	RagA-D 	"Yes, in this context, the relationship between PRAS40 and RagC, a component of RagA-D complex, is explicitly described. Sepsis causes a lack of PRAS40 raptor decrease and an increase in RagC raptor induced by Leucine (Leu) in raptor binding, which is present in control muscle. This suggests that there might be an interconnected relationship between PRAS40 and RagC in the context of mTOR activation and Leu's effect, particularly during the development of sepsis, and these alterations may contribute to the sepsis-induced Leucine resistance. Overall response: yes."
25263533	Bcl2	CD25	"Yes, in this context, there is an explicit relationship between ""Bcl2"" and ""CD25"" because after IL-2 stimulation, CD25(+) Tfh cells upregulate the production of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl2."
25263533	Bcl6	IL-2	"Yes, there is an explicit relationship between ""Bcl6"" and ""IL-2"" in this context, as it mentions that in response to IL-2, CD25(+) Bcl6(low) Tfh cells increase expression of costimulatory molecules, upregulate transcription factors, produce cytokines, and raise the levels of antiapoptotic protein Bcl2, all while undergoing further differentiation involving the downregulation of Bcl6 when encountering antigen-presenting B cells and signaling through the T-cell receptor."
25263533	Bcl6	T-cell receptor	"No, while Bcl6 and T follicular helper (Tfh) cells are described in the context and the Tfh cells interact with antigen-presenting B cells that may signal through the T-cell receptor, there is no explicit relationship specified between Bcl6 and the T-cell receptor itself."
25263533	CD25	CD45RO	"No, in this context, there is a relationship between CD25 and the characteristics of B cells that it interacts with. The CD25(+) Bcl6(low) T follicular helper cells are found in higher numbers in T:B-cell conjugates that include B cells expressing CD45RO, AID, surface IgG or IgA, and MHC class II. However, CD45RO is associated with a characteristic of B cells and not CD25 itself. So, while there's an indirect relationship, it's mainly through B cells and not CD25 and CD45RO directly. Therefore, my answer to the question would be ""no"" for a direct explicit relationship between CD25 and CD45RO."
25263533	CD25	ICOS	"No, to answer the question, the given context includes that CD25 is associated with a specific T follicular helper (Tfh) cell subpopulation, which can change its expression and engage with B cells leading to the expression of ICOS, OX40, and other costimulatory molecules after IL-2 stimulation. Even though CD25 and ICOS are both present in this subpopulation's functional response to IL-2, this context does not provide a direct explicit relationship between CD25 and ICOS itself. Therefore, based on the provided information, the answer is ""no""."
25263533	CD25	IL-2	"Yes, there is an explicit relationship between ""CD25"" and ""IL-2"" described in the context. CD25(+) Tfh cells respond to IL-2 by increasing expression of specific molecules and cytokines, and expressing higher levels of antiapoptotic protein Bcl2. Moreover, CD25 expression on Tfh cells and local production of IL-2 within the tissue may support B helper T-cell function during later stages of B-cell maturation and the development of immune memory."
25263533	CD25	IL-21	"Yes, there is an explicit relationship between ""CD25"" and ""IL-21"" as CD25(+) Tfh cells increase production of IL-21 in response to IL-2."
25263533	CD25	IgA	"No, there is no direct or explicit relationship mentioned between ""CD25"" and ""IgA"" in the given context. CD25 is related to various phenomena, including upregulation of molecules, production of cytokines, and interactions with activated B cells (BCs), but we do not see a specific relationship drawn between CD25 and IgA."
25263533	CD25	IgG	"No, ""IgG"" isn't explicitly and directly related to ""CD25"" in this context. However, it mentions a higher level of IgG expression in B cells associated with CD25(+) Bcl6(low) Tfh cells. This could be seen as an indirect relationship, but not an explicit relationship between CD25 and IgG."
25263533	CD25	MHC class II	"Yes (In this context, there is a relationship between CD25 and the functioning of T follicular helper cells (Tfh), which help mature B cells in germinal centers. Tfh-cell recognition of antigen-presenting B cells can lead to the expression of the high-affinity IL-2 receptor (CD25) on Tfh cells and responses to IL-2. B cells in conjugates with CD25(+) Bcl6(low) Tfh cells express higher levels of MHC class II compared to those with CD25(-) Bcl6(hi) Tfh cells.)"
25263533	CD25	OX40	"Yes, there is an explicit relationship between ""CD25"" and ""OX40"" as mentioned in the context, ""In response to IL-2, these CD25(+) Tfh cells increased expression of costimulatory molecules ICOS or OX40"". This suggests that CD25(+) Tfh cells upon responding to IL-2 can also express OX40."
25263533	CD25	cMaf	"Yes, there is an explicit relationship between ""CD25"" and ""cMaf"" as it is mentioned in the text that ""in response to IL-2, these CD25(+) Tfh cells increased expression of costimulatory molecules ICOS or OX40, upregulated transcription factor cMaf""."
25263533	IL-2 receptor	T-cell receptor	"Yes, there is an explicit relationship between ""IL-2 receptor"" and ""T-cell receptor"" described in this context as ""Tfh-cell recognition of antigen-presenting B cells and signaling through the T-cell receptor likely triggers expression of the high-affinity IL-2 receptor."""
25263533	IL-2	T-cell receptor	"Yes (This context indicates an explicit relationship between IL-2 and Tfh cells, a subset of T-cells, as IL-2 affects the costimulatory molecule expression, cytokine production, and survival of CD25(+) Bcl6(low) Tfh cells.)"
25263533	cMaf	IL-2	"Yes (In this context, it is established that in response to IL-2, CD25(+) Tfh cells increase expression of costimulatory molecules, upregulate transcription factor cMaf, produce cytokines, and raise levels of antiapoptotic protein Bcl2.)"
25263533	Bcl2	Bcl6 	"No, while there is a clear distinction between CD25(+) Bcl6(low) and CD25(-) Bcl6(hi) T follicular helper (Tfh) cells mentioned in the context, there isn't an explicit stated relationship between Bcl2 and Bcl6."
25305591	FoxP3	VPAC2	"Yes, there is an explicit relationship between ""FoxP3"" and ""VPAC2"" described in this context as the abundance and proliferative index of lymph node, thymus and CNS CD4 CD25 FoxP3 Tregs (regulatory T cells) was strikingly reduced in VPAC2 deficient mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Additionally, the in vitro suppressive activity of lymph node and splenic Tregs from VPAC2 deficient mice was impaired."
25622904	Cdkn2a	Sag	"Yes, in this context, there is an explicit relationship between ""Cdkn2a"" (the gene encoding p16) and ""Sag"" (SAG/RBX2 E3 ubiquitin ligase). Sag deletion leads to accumulation of p16 and the induction of senescence, while simultaneous deletion of Cdkn2a (i.e., removal of p16) rescues the senescence triggered by Sag deletion."
25622904	Fbxw7	Jun-B	"Yes, there is an explicit relationship between ""Fbxw7"" (Sag E3 ligase) and ""Jun-B"" described in the text, where Fbxw7 (Sag) promotes Jun-B degradation. Jun-B accumulation due to Sag deletion results in the induction of p16 and senescence."
25622904	Jun-B	p16	"Yes, there is an explicit relationship between ""Jun-B"" and ""p16"" described in this context as Jun-B, a substrate of Sag Fbxw7 E3 ligase, causes accumulation that associates with the induction of p16 and cellular senescence."
25622904	p16	Sag	"Yes, there is an explicit relationship between ""p16"" and ""Sag"" in this context. Sag/Rbx2 E3 ubiquitin ligase deletion causes accumulation of p16 during cell proliferation suppression and senescence induction. This relationship is driven by the accumulation of Jun-B, a substrate of Sag Fbxw7 E3 ligase, which functions as a transcription factor driving p16 transcription. Simultaneous deletion of Cdkn2a (the p16 encoding gene) can partially rescue senescence triggered by Sag deletion, showing a causal role for p16 in this process."
25622904	Cdkn2a	Fbxw7 	"Yes, there is an explicit relationship between ""Cdkn2a"" and ""Fbxw7"" in this context, as ""Jun-B,"" which is a substrate of the Sag Fbxw7 E3 ligase, drives p16 transcription from Cdkn2a. Furthermore, the role of Sag in senescence and immortalization is largely rescued by simultaneous deletion of Cdkn2a, indicating a causal relationship between the two."
25946186	P38	TIPE2	"Yes, there is an explicit relationship between ""P38"" and ""TIPE2"" described in this context, as TIPE2 is stated to promote the phosphorylation of P38 and also inhibit the phosphorylation of Akt, suggesting its potential role through these pathways in regulating lung cancer cell apoptosis."
25946186	caspase-9	TIPE2	"Yes, there is an explicit relationship between ""caspase-9"" and ""TIPE2"" mentioned in the text. TIPE2 promotes lung cancer cell apoptosis through affecting apoptosis-related molecules like caspase-3, caspase-9, Bcl-2, and Bax."
25946186	P38	caspase-9	"Yes, there is an explicit relationship between ""P38"" and ""TIPE2"" described in the context, as the study shows that TIPE2 promotes lung cancer cell apoptosis through affecting apoptosis-related molecules potentially via regulating P38 and Akt pathways. Although it mentions a relationship between some apoptosis-related molecules (including caspase-3, caspase-9) and TIPE2, a direct explicit relationship between caspase-9 and P38 is not mentioned."
25979836	CCK1-receptor	PAK2	"Yes, in this context, there is an explicit relationship between ""CCK1-receptor"" and ""PAK2"" as CCK-activation of PAK2 (in relation to pancreatic acini) requires both high- and low-affinity CCK1-receptor state activation."
25979836	CCK	PAK2	"Yes, there is an explicit relationship between ""CCK"" and ""PAK2"" as CCK (cholecystokinin) can activate PAK2 (P21-activated kinase 2) in pancreatic acinar cells described in the given context. This activation occurs via small GTPases (CDC42/Rac1), PKC (protein kinase C), and SFK (Src family kinases) and is not dependent on cytosolic calcium or PI3K (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase)."
25979836	CCK	PKC	"Yes, there is an explicit relationship between ""CCK"" (Cholera toxin/cholecystokinin) and ""PKC"" (Protein kinase C) mentioned in the text. The activation of Group-I-PAKs, specifically PAK2, by CCK requires both high- and low-affinity CCK1-receptor state activation and is partially reduced by PKC inhibition."
25979836	CCK	PLC	"Yes, to answer this question, focus on the mention of CCK (Cholecystokinin) and PLC (Phospholipase C) in the given context. It is mentioned that secretagogues activating phospholipase-C (PLC) [CCK, carbachol, bombesin] can activate PAK2. Thus, there is a clear relationship between CCK and PLC because CCK is an example of a secretagogue that activates PLC. Therefore, the answer is ""yes""."
25979836	CCK	SFK	"Yes, to answer this question based on the given text, we need to identify information about CCK (cholecystokinin) and SFK (Src family kinases). The text explains that CCK activation of PAK2 requires both high- and low-affinity CCK1-receptor states and involves PKC (protein kinase C) or Src-inhibition, but not with PI3K (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase) inhibitors or thapsigargin. Regarding SFK, the text shows that CCK and other stimuli activate PAK2 via PKC and SFK (Src family kinases). This suggests that there is an explicit relationship between CCK and SFK since both affect PAK2 activation. However, it is important to note that this is the only explicit relationship provided in the text."
25979836	CCK	small-GTPase	"Yes, there is an explicit relationship between ""CCK"" (cholecystokinin) and ""small-GTPase"" as the text discusses the involvement of small GTPases (CDC42/Rac1) in CCK-mediated activation of PAK2 in pancreatic acini."
25979836	PAK2	PKC	"Yes, based on the given context, there is a relationship between ""PAK2"" and ""PKC"" as PKC-inhibition partially reduced CCK-activation of PAK2 in pancreatic acini."
25979836	PAK2	PLC	"Yes, to answer this question, we need to examine the relationship between ""PAK2"" and ""PLC"" as presented in the given context. The provided text mentions acini, which have only one Group-I-PAK, PAK2. It further explains that PAK2 is activated by agents (such as CCK, carbachol, and bombesin) activating phospholipase-C (PLC). This information establishes a direct relationship between PAK2 and PLC in the specific context provided.   Therefore, based on the context given, the answer is ""yes""."
25979836	PAK2	SFK	"Yes, according to this context, there is an explicit relationship between ""PAK2"" and ""SFK"" as it states that CCK and other gastrointestinal (GI) hormones/neurotransmitters/growth-factors activate PAK2 via small GTPases (CDC42/Rac1), PKC, and SFK."
25979836	PAK2	small-GTPase	"Yes, the text explicitly relates ""PAK2"" to ""small-GTPases"" as they demonstrated that GI hormones/neurotransmitters/growth-factors activate PAK2 via small GTPases (CDC42/Rac1)."
25979836	amylase	CCK	"No, to answer the question, we need to focus only on the explicit relationship between amylase and CCK from the given text. The text explains that IPA-3, which partially inhibits CCK-induced activation of PAK2, also reduces CCK-induced amylase release. This indicates that CCK might have an indirect relationship with amylase by influencing PAK2. However, directly from the provided context, the relationship between amylase and CCK is not explicit, but rather involves PAK2 as an intermediate in this signal transduction pathway. So the answer would be ""no"", since a direct explicit relationship between amylase and CCK is not presented in the given context."
25979836	CCK1-receptor	CCK 	"Yes, there is an explicit relationship between ""CCK1-receptor"" and ""CCK"" as the context mentions that the activation of PAK2 (p21-activated kinase) by CCK (cholecystokinin) required both high- and low-affinity CCK1-receptor state activation."
25983002	LDHA	MMP-9	"Yes, there is an explicit relationship between LDHA (lactate dehydrogenase A) and MMP-9 (matrix metalloproteinase 9) as decreased LDHA expression or activity leads to reduced MMP-9 expression in PC-3 and DU145 prostate cancer cells."
25983002	LDHA	PLAU	"Yes, there is an explicit relationship between ""LDHA"" and ""PLAU"" as the text mentions that reduced expression of MMP-9, PLAU, and cathepsin B were found after LDHA knockdown or FX11 treatment in PC-3 and DU145 cells."
25983002	MMP-9	PLAU	"No, there is no explicit relationship directly mentioned between ""MMP-9"" and ""PLAU"" in this context. However, it is stated that the reduced expression of both MMP-9, PLAU, and cathepsin B were found after LDHA knockdown or FX11 treatment in PC-3 and DU145 cells."
26027517	autotaxin	GPCR	"Yes, there is an explicit relationship between ""autotaxin"" and ""GPCR"" through the ""ATX-LPA2 GPCR axis"" described in the context. The function of this axis is modulated by gamma-irradiation and aids in DNA damage repair. LPA2 is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that is part of this axis in response to DNA damage."
26027517	gamma-H2AX	LPA1    '3	"No, the explicit relationship between ""gamma-H2AX"" and ""LPA1   '3"" is not established in the given context. The relationship described is between ""gamma-H2AX"" and ""LPA2""."
26027517	autotaxin	gamma-H2AX 	Yes (Note: The explicit relationship stated in the context is that both autotaxin and LPA2 (Lysophosphatidic acid receptor 2) contribute to the enhancement of DNA damage repair after gamma-irradiation.)
26411452	Androgen Receptor	Melanophilin	"Yes, there is an explicit relationship between ""Androgen Receptor"" and ""Melanophilin"", as the presence of a putative Prostate Cancer risk SNP in an Androgen Receptor-binding site of the Melanophilin gene is described in this context. This relationship impacts the transcriptional activity and expression of the MLPH gene possibly contributing to tumor-suppressive effects."
26411452	ERG	TMPRSS2	"Yes (The relationship between ""ERG"" and the context is through the TMPRSS2-ERG gene rearrangement in PCa cells, while the explicit relationship between ""ERG"" and ""TMPRSS2"" is established by the gene rearrangement.)"
26411452	Androgen Receptor	ERG 	"Yes, there is an explicit relationship mentioned between ""Androgen Receptor"" and ""ERG"" in the context provided. They are mentioned in the context of the TMPRSS2 ERG gene rearrangement positive DUCaP cells. Additionally, there is a direct relationship established between Androgen Receptor (AR) and the MLPH gene, which is another connection in this context."
27014915	cIAP1	Smac	"Yes (Based on the given context, there is a relationship between cIAP1 and the radiation-induced induction of Smac mimetic BV6, as BV6 induces cIAP1 and cIAP2 degradation to enhance radiation-mediated tumor suppression.)"
27014915	cIAP2	Smac	"Yes (The relationship mentioned in the context is that radiation induces TNFa in tumor cells, which induces tumor cell death in an autocrine manner; Smac mimetic BV6 increases tumor cell sensitivity to radiation-induced cell death by inducing cIAP1 and cIAP2 degradation.) While cIAP2 is mentioned, its relationship with Smac is not directly described for the tumor-suppression activity. However, since Smac mimetic BV6 affects cIAP1 and cIAP2, there is an indirect relationship between Smac (through BV6) and cIAP2."
27014915	cIAP1	cIAP2	"No, to answer this question, we need to look for any direct relationship between ""cIAP1"" and ""cIAP2"" in the provided context. However, the text does not explicitly establish a direct relationship between these two terms beyond their mention in the context of a sublethal dose of Smac mimetic BV6 inducing their degradation. So, based on the given information, the answer is ""no""."
27084744	CD133	N1ICD	"Yes, there is an explicit relationship between ""CD133"" and ""N1ICD"" as CD133-positive ACC cells produce activated NOTCH1 (N1ICD). Knockdowns of NOTCH1 and its common effector FABP7 also inhibited spheroidogenesis and induced cell death, emphasizing their essential roles in CSC (cancer stem-like cells) maintenance. Additionally, a g-secretase inhibitor depleted CD133 cells and suppressed N1ICD, further connecting both molecules."
27084744	CD133	NOTCH1	"Yes, there is an explicit relationship between ""CD133"" and ""NOTCH1"" in the context provided since CD133-positive CSC expressed NOTCH1 and the experimental results demonstrate that NOTCH1 is essential for the maintenance and propagation of these cancer stem-like cells in Adenoid Cystic Carcinoma (ACC)."
27084744	CD133	SOX10	"Yes, to answer this question, I analyzed the given context to identify any explicit relationship between CD133 and SOX10. The text indicates that CD133-positive CSC from ACC expressed NOTCH1 and SOX10 and that knockdowns of NOTCH1, SOX10, and their common effector FABP7 had negative effects on each other. This suggests that there might be a connection between CD133 and SOX10 through their common association in CD133-positive CSC, as well as sharing NOTCH1 and FABP7 as some related signaling pathways. So, yes, there is an explicit relationship between CD133 and SOX10 in this context."
27084744	CD133	g-secretase	"No, to answer the given question, I analyzed the context provided, which discusses the relationship between CD133, NOTCH1, SOX10, and other molecules in the context of adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC). The context mentions that among the NOTCH1/FABP7 targets in the proliferation-linked pathway, SKP2 is identified. Furthermore, it is stated that a gamma (g)-secretase inhibitor, DAPT, selectively depletes CD133 cells. Although g-secretase is mentioned in relation to DAPT, an explicit direct relationship between CD133 and g-secretase is not directly stated in the provided context.  Answer: no"
27084744	g-secretase	N1ICD	"Yes, there is an explicit relationship between ""g-secretase"" and ""N1ICD"" as a g-secretase inhibitor, DAPT, selectively depletes CD133 cells, suppresses N1ICD, and induces p27Kip1."
27084744	g-secretase	SKP2	"Yes, to answer the given question, we need to determine if there is an explicit relationship between ""g-secretase"" and ""SKP2"" in this context. From the provided text, we see a mention that ""A g-secretase inhibitor, DAPT, selectively depleted CD133 cells, suppressed N1ICD and SKP2, induced p27Kip1, inhibited ACC growth in vivo, and sensitized CD133 cells to radiation."" This indicates that there is a relationship between g-secretase (inhibited by DAPT) and SKP2 since DAPT suppressed SKP2. Therefore, my answer is ""yes""."
27084744	CD133	SKP2 	"No, in this context, there is an explicit relationship between ""NOTCH1"" and ""SKP2"" through the common effector ""FABP7"". Although CD133 is identified as a marker for stem-like cells in adenoid cystic carcinoma, the text does not directly establish a relationship between CD133 and SKP2. So, the answer is ""no"" for a direct explicit relationship between CD133 and SKP2 from the provided text."
27134166	HIF1a	MCT4	Yes (HIF1a is explicitly shown to be dependent for the indication of glycolysis through the induction of MCT4 in hypoxic cells in the context of adaptive resistance.)

27248656	Hsp90beta	TAK1	Yes (Hsp90beta is explicitly demonstrated to interact with TAK1 in this context through Co-IP results.)
27248656	Hsp90beta	p38	"Yes, there is an explicit relationship between ""Hsp90beta"" and ""p38"" in the given context. This relationship is demonstrated as Hsp90beta being involved in activating the p38 signalling cascade, which can be disrupted by Hsp90beta inhibition. This disruption, in turn, leads to renal improvements as shown in the study."
27248656	HIF-1alpha	IKKalpha/beta 	"Yes, there is an explicit relationship between Hsp90beta and IKKalpha/beta, as the text states that Hsp90beta can interact with and stabilize IKKalpha/beta."

27959382	Bach1	glutathione peroxidase 1	"Yes, to answer this question as requested, we focus only on the relationships explicitly mentioned between ""Bach1"" and ""glutathione peroxidase 1"" in the provided context. Though it does not directly state an explicit relationship between Bach1 and Glutathione peroxidase 1, it says, ""Bach1 siRNA enhanced the expression of antioxidant factors, but suppressed that of fibrosis-related cytokines in mice."" Glutathione peroxidase 1 is mentioned as an antioxidant factor. So, we could infer that there is an indirect relationship as Bach1 siRNA has a regulatory effect on glutathione peroxidase 1. However, to strictly follow the instruction and only include explicitly described relationships, we cannot confidently say 'yes' to an explicit relationship between them based solely on the given context."
27959382	Bach1	heme oxygenase-1	"Yes, there is an explicit relationship between ""Bach1"" and ""heme oxygenase-1"" described in the context, as Bach1 siRNA is shown to increase the mRNA and protein expression levels of heme oxygenase-1. This indicates that Bach1 might play a role in regulating heme oxygenase-1 expression."
27959382	Bach1	interleukin-6	"Yes, there is an explicit relationship between ""Bach1"" and ""interleukin-6"" as the text mentions downregulated interleukin-6 levels in MLFs infected with Bach1 siRNA and a suppressed level of interleukin-6 in mice with Bach1 knockdown."
27959382	Bach1	transforming growth factor (TGF)-b1	"No, the explicit relationship between ""Bach1"" and ""transforming growth factor (TGF)-b1"" described in the context is that Bach1 siRNA downregulates the TGF-b1 and interleukin-6 levels in mouse lung fibroblast cell supernatants. However, this context does not provide a direct relationship between the two proteins in their molecular functions or mechanisms."
27959382	antioxidant factors	Bach1	"Yes, there is an explicit relationship between ""antioxidant factors"" and ""Bach1"" in this context since Bach1 siRNA is shown to enhance the expression of antioxidant factors and suppressed the expression of fibrosis-related cytokines."
27959382	Bach1	antioxidant factor	"Yes, there is an explicit relationship between ""Bach1"" and ""antioxidant factor"" where Bach1 appears to modulate and influence the expression of antioxidant factors like heme oxygenase-1 and glutathione peroxidase 1. This relationship is shown through the downregulation of Bach1 resulting in increased levels of antioxidant factors within the lung fibroblasts and mice."
28075473	interferon-g	Toll-like receptor 4	"Yes, there is an explicit relationship between ""interferon-g"" and ""Toll-like receptor 4"" as the antitumor effects of Spirulina LPS are mediated through TLR4, leading to increased interferon-g levels, and the inhibition of tumor growth is dependent on the functional presence of TLR4."
28075473	interleukin-17	Toll-like receptor 4	"Yes (The relationship between interleukin-17 and Toll-like receptor 4 is explicitly shown as tumor growth was suppressed by Spirulina LPS in C3H/HeN mice but not in TLR4-mutant C3H/HeJ mice, potentially through modulation of cytokines, such as interleukin-17 and interferon-g.)"
28075473	interleukin-23	Toll-like receptor 4	"Yes, there is an explicit relationship between ""interleukin-23"" and ""Toll-like receptor 4"" in this context. The text mentions that Spirulina LPS suppresses tumor growth in a Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) dependent manner by altering the cytokine milieu from interleukin-17 interleukin-23 to interferon-g. TLR4 is involved in the actions or mechanisms impacting interleukin-23 production."
28075473	interferon-g	interleukin-17 	"Yes (Interferon-gamma [interferon-g] and interleukin-17 are explicitly related as their levels are altered in the presence of Spirulina lipopolysaccharides, resulting in tumor growth inhibition.)"
28098423	Akt	BDNF	"Yes, there is an explicit relationship between ""Akt"" and ""BDNF"" described in this context. BDNF activates the Akt signalling pathway, which is involved in the cardioprotective effect against doxorubicin-induced cardiac dysfunction, and the beneficial effect of BDNF is abolished by inhibiting Akt or using a BDNF scavenger."
28098423	Akt	Brain-derived neurotrophic factor	"Yes, there is an explicit relationship between ""Akt"" and ""Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)"" in this context, as BDNF activates the Akt signalling pathway in protecting against Dox-induced cardiotoxicity."

However, it doesn't explicitly describe a relationship between ""Bad"" and ""BDNF"" when referring to the concept of something being bad or undesirable."
28098423	Akt	Bad 	"Yes, there is an explicit relationship between ""Akt"" and ""Bad"" described in this context. BDNF, through activating Akt signaling, preserves phosphorylation of mammalian target of rapamycin and Bad."
28101574	MMP-2	NEK2	"Yes, in the given context, there is an explicit relationship between MMP-2 and NEK2 as their expressions are positively correlated (r=0.781, P<0.01). This relationship suggests that alteration of NEK2 protein levels may contribute to invasion and metastasis of HCC potentially through promotion of MMP-2 expression."
28148288	ADAM12	claudin	"Yes, there is an explicit relationship between ""ADAM12"" and ""claudin-low breast cancer"" as ADAM12 is actively promoting the stem cell-like phenotype in claudin-low breast cancer cells.

28204828	Bax	Bcl-2 	"No, in this context, the relationship between ""Bax"" and ""Bcl-2"" is not explicitly discussed or shown. However, there is a mention of altered expression of Bcl-2 and Bax along with Pten, Akt, and VEGF due to TIEG1 deficiency."
28260056	IGF-1R	PI3K	Yes (The text explains that IGF-1R is related to the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway in promoting autophagy and increasing cell viability under hypoxic conditions.)
28260056	Insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor	PI3K	Yes
28260056	IGF-1R	Insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor	"Yes, there is an explicit relationship between ""IGF-1R"" and ""Insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor"" as the context describes the role and mechanisms of IGF-1R, which is directly linked to the Insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor.

28348168	FGFR2	SOX2	"Yes, there is an explicit correlation between FGFR2 signaling and the maintenance of expression of SOX2 in airway basal cell self-renewal and differentiation."
28368423	B-cell receptor	Myc	"Yes, there is an explicit relationship between ""B-cell receptor"" and ""Myc"" as Myc enhances B-cell receptor signaling and elevated MYC levels contribute to increased BCR and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways in pre-malignant B cells. Thus, it impacts B-cell transformation and confers resistance to inhibition of BCR signaling."
28368423	BCR	MYC	Yes (Myc enhances B-cell receptor signaling in precancerous B cells.)
28368423	BCR	Myc	"Yes, there is an explicit relationship between ""BCR"" and ""Myc"" in this context. Myc enhances B-cell receptor signaling in precancerous B cells and is associated with more aggressive phenotypes and poor prognosis in B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (B-NHL). Overexpression of Myc in B cells increases both basal and stimulated BCR signaling and leads to resistance to pharmacologic inhibitors of BCR signaling, such as ibrutinib."
28368423	Btk	Myc	"Yes, there is an explicit relationship between ""Btk"" and ""Myc"" in the given context. Myc overexpression leads to increased BCR signaling and confers resistance to Btk inhibition, such as the drug ibrutinib, in pre-malignant B cells."
28368423	CD79a	Myc	"Yes, there is an explicit relationship between ""CD79a"" and ""Myc"" as increased basal and stimulated BCR signaling in precancerous B cells from the Eu-myc mouse model led to constitutively higher levels of activated CD79a due to Myc overexpression."

28368537	LIF	Lifr	"Yes, there is an explicit relationship between ""LIF"" (leukemia inhibitory factor) and ""Lifr"" (LIF receptor) in this context. The LIF binds to the LIFR in the uterine luminal epithelium, leading to the activation of the Jak-Stat3 signaling pathway and ultimately converting the uterus into a receptive state for blastocyst implantation. A specific ablation of the LIFR in the LE using a Ltf-Cre mouse line and a conditional Lifr flx/flx gene results in implantation failure, highlighting the importance of this relationship in the implantation process."
28368537	LIF	Msx1	"Yes (The explicit relationship between ""LIF"" and ""Msx1"" is described as Msx1 being a LIF-regulated gene involved in the regulation of uterine receptivity.)"
28368537	Lifr	Ltf	"Yes, in the given context, there is an explicit relationship between ""Lifr"" (LIF receptor) and ""Ltf"" (lactoferrin gene). The Ltf-Cre mice line is created by inserting the Cre recombinase into the endogenous Ltf gene while the Lifr receptor is studied for its role in implantation.
