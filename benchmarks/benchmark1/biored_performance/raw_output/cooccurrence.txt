 We cloned the cDNA of three remaining human NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunits of this IP fraction: the NDUFS2 (49 kDa), NDUFS3 (30 kDa), and NDUFS6 (13 kDa) subunits.	4		NDUFS2	NDUFS3	9647766

CD72 polymorphisms associated with alternative splicing modify susceptibility to human systemic lupus erythematosus through epistatic interaction with FCGR2B.	1	associate interact	CD72	FCGR2B	15459183
 Because polymorphism of CD72, another inhibitory receptor of B cells, was associated with murine SLE, we identified human CD72 polymorphisms, tested their association with SLE and examined genetic interaction with FCGR2B in the Japanese (160 SLE, 277 controls), Thais (87 SLE, 187 controls) and Caucasians (94 families containing SLE members).	3	associate inhibit interact	CD72	FCGR2B	15459183
 Using the two Asian cohorts, significant association of FCGR2B-232Thr/Thr with SLE was observed only in the presence of CD72-*1/*1 genotype (OR 4.63, 95% CI 1.47-14.6, P=0.009 versus FCGR2B-232Ile/Ile plus CD72-*2/*2).	9		CD72	FCGR2B	15459183
