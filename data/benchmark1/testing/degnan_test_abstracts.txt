15236594	ER-60	CNX	True Positive	ER-60 domains responsible for interaction with calnexin and calreticulin. ER-60 is a thiol oxidoreductase family protein of the endoplasmic reticulum that facilitates the oxidative folding of glycoproteins via interaction with calnexin (CNX) and calreticulin (CRT). In this study, we tried to identify the site of interaction with CNX and CRT in the ER-60 molecule. ER-60 was shown to be composed of at least four domains, named a, b, b', and a', by limited proteolysis. Recombinant fragments of ER-60, a, b', and a'c, were each expressed in Escherichia coli as an individual soluble folded protein that underwent a cooperative unfolding transition along a urea gradient. These fragments each gave the circular dichroism (CD) spectrum of the folded protein. On the other hand, fragment b, which did not undergo the cooperative unfolding transition along a urea gradient gel, did not show any sign of the folded structure on the CD measurement. However, subtraction of the spectra showed that the b domain was folded in wild-type ER-60 or abb'. Both a and a'c, which have a catalytic center CGHC motif, showed activity almost equivalent to half of that of wild-type ER-60. Extension from a or a'c to ab and abb' or b'a'c had little effect on their isomerase activity, suggesting that the b and b' domains hardly contribute to the catalytic activity of ER-60. The contribution of both the b and b' domains to the binding with CNX and CRT was revealed by surface plasmon resonance analysis and oxidative-refolding experiments of monoglucosylated RNase B with addition of the luminal domain of CNX.

15246187	Cox-2	EGFR	True Positive	Co-expression of Cox-2 and EGFR in stage I human bronchial adenocarcinomas. Cyclooxygenase (Cox)-2 plays an important role in cell proliferation, carcinogenesis and tumor growth, in part through the synthesis of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) as well as through other yet unknown routes. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling regulates Cox-2 expression, which has not been thoroughly examined in bronchial carcinomas. The current study examined the expression of Cox-2, EGFR, P53 and proliferative marker Ki-67 immunoreactivities by immunohistochemistry in 71 surgically removed stage I bronchial adenocarcinomas. Furthermore, we evaluated the prognostic value of these molecules to elucidate the biological significance of Cox-2 expression. Higher Cox-2 expression (more than 10% immunoreactivities in tumor cells) was strongly associated with higher EGFR and P53 expression as well as a Ki-67 LI above 20% (P &lt; 0.01). Cox-2 and EGFR immunoreactive tumor cells showed a similar distribution pattern. Five-year survival rate was 73% in 57 cases showing higher Cox-2 expression and 100% in 14 cases showing lower expression, indicating a significant difference in survival (P = 0.040). Higher Cox-2 expression might be associated with tumor progression and worse prognosis through EGFR signaling interaction in Stage I bronchial adenocarcinomas.

15248066	AQP1	AQP3	True Negative	Bronchiolar expression of aquaporin-3 (AQP3) in rat lung and its dynamics in pulmonary oedema. Aquaporins (AQPs) are water channel proteins that permit osmotically driven water movement. To determine their dynamics in pulmonary oedema, we examined the expression of mRNA and protein for AQP1, AQP3, AQP4, and AQP5 in the lungs of normal and thiourea-treated rats. In the thiourea group, lung water content increased significantly (vs. controls) with the peak at around 4 h. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR showed that AQP3 mRNA in the thiourea group rose significantly, peaking at around 4-8 h. The expression of AQP1, AQP4, AQP5, ENaC and CFTR mRNA each decreased significantly some time after the peak in lung water content. Immunoblot analysis showed that glycosylated AQP3 protein was increased 4-10 h after treatment. Expression of the other AQP proteins was not significantly altered, except for that of AQP4. Immunohistochemical examination revealed that AQP1 was expressed in endothelia, AQP3 in the basal cells of the large airways and in cuboidal cells in the bronchioles, AQP4 in the basolateral membrane of airway cells and AQP5 in type-I pneumocytes. Our results suggest that AQP3 is expressed not only in large airways, but also in bronchioles, and is related to water movement in pulmonary oedema.

Immunoblot analysis showed that glycosylated AQP3 protein was increased 4-10 h after treatment. Expression of the other AQP proteins was not significantly altered, except for that of AQP4. Immunohistochemical examination revealed that AQP1 was expressed in endothelia, AQP3 in the basal cells of the large airways and in cuboidal cells in the bronchioles, AQP4 in the basolateral membrane of airway cells and AQP5 in type-I pneumocytes. Our results suggest that AQP3 is expressed not only in large airways, but also in bronchioles, and is related to water movement in pulmonary oedema.
15248066	ENaC	CFTR	True Negative	Bronchiolar expression of aquaporin-3 (AQP3) in rat lung and its dynamics in pulmonary oedema. Aquaporins (AQPs) are water channel proteins that permit osmotically driven water movement. To determine their dynamics in pulmonary oedema, we examined the expression of mRNA and protein for AQP1, AQP3, AQP4, and AQP5 in the lungs of normal and thiourea-treated rats. In the thiourea group, lung water content increased significantly (vs. controls) with the peak at around 4 h. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR showed that AQP3 mRNA in the thiourea group rose significantly, peaking at around 4-8 h. The expression of AQP1, AQP4, AQP5, ENaC and CFTR mRNA each decreased significantly some time after the peak in lung water content.

15248214	rsCD154	TNFalpha	True Positive	Amplification of the synovial inflammatory response through activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases and nuclear factor kappaB using ligation of CD40 on CD14+ synovial cells from patients with rheumatoid arthritis. To determine the signal transduction pathways in CD14+ synovial cells from patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) after CD40 ligation, and to examine their role in amplifying synovial inflammation in affected joints. Expression of messenger RNA was analyzed using quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Cytokines and chemokines were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Activation of kinases was detected using Western blotting. Nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB was examined using immunohistochemistry. CD14+ synovial cells were enriched using magnetic cell sorting. Fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) were obtained by passaging primary synovial cell culture. Stimulation of CD14+ synovial cells from RA patients by recombinant soluble CD154 (rsCD154) significantly induced expression of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha), interleukin-1alpha (IL-1alpha), and IL-1beta. CD14+ RA synovial cells stimulated with rsCD154 plus interferon-gamma (IFNgamma) induced significantly higher production of IL-6, IL-8, and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 by FLS compared with unstimulated CD14+ synovial cells, through TNFalpha, IL-1alpha, and IL-1beta mediated pathways. Stimulation with rsCD154 plus IFNgamma induced the activation of ERK-1, ERK-2, p38 MAPK, and NF-kappaB. Specific inhibitors of MAPK ERK-1 ERK-2 kinases and p38 MAPK significantly reduced the production of TNFalpha and IL-1beta by rsCD154 plus IFNgamma-stimulated CD14+ synovial cells, and also inhibited production of these cytokines by freshly isolated synovial cells from RA patients. These data indicate that the CD40 CD154 interaction activates the ERK, p38, and NF-kappaB pathways in CD14+ synovial cells from RA patients to produce TNFalpha, IL-1alpha, and IL-1beta, which in turn amplifies inflammatory responses by stimulating FLS. Inhibition of the CD40 CD154 interaction or its signal transduction pathways would be a strong and efficient strategy for the management of synovial inflammation in RA.

Specific inhibitors of MAPK ERK-1 ERK-2 kinases and p38 MAPK significantly reduced the production of TNFalpha and IL-1beta by rsCD154 plus IFNgamma-stimulated CD14+ synovial cells, and also inhibited production of these cytokines by freshly isolated synovial cells from RA patients. These data indicate that the CD40 CD154 interaction activates the ERK, p38, and NF-kappaB pathways in CD14+ synovial cells from RA patients to produce TNFalpha, IL-1alpha, and IL-1beta, which in turn amplifies inflammatory responses by stimulating FLS. Inhibition of the CD40 CD154 interaction or its signal transduction pathways would be a strong and efficient strategy for the management of synovial inflammation in RA.

Activation of kinases was detected using Western blotting. Nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB was examined using immunohistochemistry. CD14+ synovial cells were enriched using magnetic cell sorting. Fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) were obtained by passaging primary synovial cell culture. Stimulation of CD14+ synovial cells from RA patients by recombinant soluble CD154 (rsCD154) significantly induced expression of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha), interleukin-1alpha (IL-1alpha), and IL-1beta. CD14+ RA synovial cells stimulated with rsCD154 plus interferon-gamma (IFNgamma) induced significantly higher production of IL-6, IL-8, and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 by FLS compared with unstimulated CD14+ synovial cells, through TNFalpha, IL-1alpha, and IL-1beta mediated pathways. Stimulation with rsCD154 plus IFNgamma induced the activation of ERK-1, ERK-2, p38 MAPK, and NF-kappaB. Specific inhibitors of MAPK ERK-1 ERK-2 kinases and p38 MAPK significantly reduced the production of TNFalpha and IL-1beta by rsCD154 plus IFNgamma-stimulated CD14+ synovial cells, and also inhibited production of these cytokines by freshly isolated synovial cells from RA patients. These data indicate that the CD40 CD154 interaction activates the ERK, p38, and NF-kappaB pathways in CD14+ synovial cells from RA patients to produce TNFalpha, IL-1alpha, and IL-1beta, which in turn amplifies inflammatory responses by stimulating FLS. Inhibition of the CD40 CD154 interaction or its signal transduction pathways would be a strong and efficient strategy for the management of synovial inflammation in RA.

Stimulation of CD14+ synovial cells from RA patients by recombinant soluble CD154 (rsCD154) significantly induced expression of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha), interleukin-1alpha (IL-1alpha), and IL-1beta. CD14+ RA synovial cells stimulated with rsCD154 plus interferon-gamma (IFNgamma) induced significantly higher production of IL-6, IL-8, and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 by FLS compared with unstimulated CD14+ synovial cells, through TNFalpha, IL-1alpha, and IL-1beta mediated pathways. Stimulation with rsCD154 plus IFNgamma induced the activation of ERK-1, ERK-2, p38 MAPK, and NF-kappaB. Specific inhibitors of MAPK ERK-1 ERK-2 kinases and p38 MAPK significantly reduced the production of TNFalpha and IL-1beta by rsCD154 plus IFNgamma-stimulated CD14+ synovial cells, and also inhibited production of these cytokines by freshly isolated synovial cells from RA patients. These data indicate that the CD40 CD154 interaction activates the ERK, p38, and NF-kappaB pathways in CD14+ synovial cells from RA patients to produce TNFalpha, IL-1alpha, and IL-1beta, which in turn amplifies inflammatory responses by stimulating FLS. Inhibition of the CD40 CD154 interaction or its signal transduction pathways would be a strong and efficient strategy for the management of synovial inflammation in RA.

To determine the signal transduction pathways in CD14+ synovial cells from patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) after CD40 ligation, and to examine their role in amplifying synovial inflammation in affected joints. Expression of messenger RNA was analyzed using quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Cytokines and chemokines were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Activation of kinases was detected using Western blotting. Nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB was examined using immunohistochemistry. CD14+ synovial cells were enriched using magnetic cell sorting. Fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) were obtained by passaging primary synovial cell culture. Stimulation of CD14+ synovial cells from RA patients by recombinant soluble CD154 (rsCD154) significantly induced expression of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha), interleukin-1alpha (IL-1alpha), and IL-1beta. CD14+ RA synovial cells stimulated with rsCD154 plus interferon-gamma (IFNgamma) induced significantly higher production of IL-6, IL-8, and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 by FLS compared with unstimulated CD14+ synovial cells, through TNFalpha, IL-1alpha, and IL-1beta mediated pathways. Stimulation with rsCD154 plus IFNgamma induced the activation of ERK-1, ERK-2, p38 MAPK, and NF-kappaB. Specific inhibitors of MAPK ERK-1 ERK-2 kinases and p38 MAPK significantly reduced the production of TNFalpha and IL-1beta by rsCD154 plus IFNgamma-stimulated CD14+ synovial cells, and also inhibited production of these cytokines by freshly isolated synovial cells from RA patients. These data indicate that the CD40 CD154 interaction activates the ERK, p38, and NF-kappaB pathways in CD14+ synovial cells from RA patients to produce TNFalpha, IL-1alpha, and IL-1beta, which in turn amplifies inflammatory responses by stimulating FLS.

CD14+ RA synovial cells stimulated with rsCD154 plus interferon-gamma (IFNgamma) induced significantly higher production of IL-6, IL-8, and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 by FLS compared with unstimulated CD14+ synovial cells, through TNFalpha, IL-1alpha, and IL-1beta mediated pathways. Stimulation with rsCD154 plus IFNgamma induced the activation of ERK-1, ERK-2, p38 MAPK, and NF-kappaB. Specific inhibitors of MAPK ERK-1 ERK-2 kinases and p38 MAPK significantly reduced the production of TNFalpha and IL-1beta by rsCD154 plus IFNgamma-stimulated CD14+ synovial cells, and also inhibited production of these cytokines by freshly isolated synovial cells from RA patients. These data indicate that the CD40 CD154 interaction activates the ERK, p38, and NF-kappaB pathways in CD14+ synovial cells from RA patients to produce TNFalpha, IL-1alpha, and IL-1beta, which in turn amplifies inflammatory responses by stimulating FLS. Inhibition of the CD40 CD154 interaction or its signal transduction pathways would be a strong and efficient strategy for the management of synovial inflammation in RA.

15251861	HO-1	AT1	True Negative	Angiotensin II induces carbon monoxide production in the perfused kidney: relationship to protein kinase C activation. Heme oxygenase (HO)-derived carbon monoxide (CO) attenuates vascular reactivity to constrictor stimuli. ANG II produces vasoconstriction and induces HO-1 isoform expression. However, direct evidence that ANG II promotes HO product generation is lacking. Therefore, we examined the effects of ANG II on CO release and HO isoform expression in isolated rat kidneys. Kidneys were perfused with oxygenated Krebs buffer. ANG II (1 micromol/l) increased (P &lt; 0.05) perfusion pressure from 97 +/- 9 to 150 +/- 14 mmHg; it also increased (P &lt; 0.05) the concentration of CO in the venous effluent (from 27.1 +/- 11.9 to 45.6 +/- 11.7, 62.5 +/- 16.7, 94.8 +/- 20.7, and 101.9 +/- 13.1 nmol/l after 30, 60, 90, and 120 min, respectively). The pressor effect of ANG II was blunted (P &lt; 0.05) in kidneys perfused with buffer containing losartan (10 micromol/l) or PKC inhibitors staurosporine (0.1 micromol/l) or calphostin C (1 micromol/l). Kidneys perfused with buffer containing ANG II for 120 min also displayed increased (P &lt; 0.05) HO-1 expression. Stannous mesoporphyrin (30 micromol/l) decreased CO release (P &lt; 0.05) in preparations perfused with and without ANG II; the HO inhibitor also increased (P &lt; 0.05) perfusion pressure, more so in kidneys perfused with that without ANG II. We conclude that ANG II stimulates CO production and release in isolated, perfused rat kidneys. This action of ANG II is linked to the activation of AT1 receptors and involves PKC activation and upregulation of renal HO-1 but not of HO-2 protein expression. The study suggests upregulation of renal HO-1 and CO release are protagonic events in a counterregulatory mechanism that attenuates ANG II-induced renal vasoconstriction.

Hsp90 cooperates with its co-chaperone Cdc37 to provide obligatory support to numerous protein kinases involved in the regulation of cellular signal transduction pathways. In this report, the crystal structure of the Src family tyrosine kinase Lck was used to guide the creation of kinase constructs to determine features recognized by Hsp90 and its \kinase-specific\ co-chaperone Cdc37. Two parameters were assayed: the ability and extent to which the constructs bound to Hsp90 and Cdc37, and the ability of the constructs to trigger salt-resistant high affinity complexes with Hsp90 and Cdc37 independent of the presence of molybdate. Although Hsp90 interacted with both the N-terminal and C-terminal lobes (NL and CL, respectively) of the catalytic domains of the kinases, the lobes themselves were not sufficient to trigger the high affinity binding of Hsp90. Only constructs containing a complete N- or C-terminal lobe and part of the adjacent lobe bound to Hsp90 and Cdc37 in salt-stable complexes independent of molybdate. The two minimum constructs that bound Hsp90 and Cdc37 contained the alpha-C-helix and the beta4- and beta5-strands of the NL through to end of the CL and the NL through to the alpha-E-helix and the amino acids that cap the helix. Cdc37 interacted with only the NL and minimally required the alpha-C-helix and beta4- and beta5-strands of this lobe of Lck. The results indicate that the high affinity binding activity of Hsp90 is triggered through its interaction with adjacent subdomain structures of kinase catalytic domains. Furthermore, the alpha-C-helix and part of its adjoining loop connection to the beta4-strand appear to be the primary determinants recognized by Cdc37.

15258196	PLTP	HDL	True Positive	PLTP deficiency improves the anti-inflammatory properties of HDL and reduces the ability of LDL to induce monocyte chemotactic activity. We reported that phospholipid transfer protein (PLTP) deficiency decreased atherosclerosis in mouse models. Because the decreased atherosclerosis was accompanied by a significant decrease in plasma HDL levels, we examined the properties of PLTP knockout (PLTP0) HDL and tested its ability to prevent LDL-induced monocyte chemotactic activity in human artery wall cell cocultures. We isolated HDL and LDL from LDL receptor knockout/PLTP knockout (LDLr0/PLTP0) mice and from apolipoprotein B transgenic (apoBTg)/PLTP0 mice as well as their controls. PLTP0 HDL was relatively rich in protein and depleted in phosphatidylcholine. Turnover studies revealed a 3.5- to 4.0-fold increase in the turnover of protein and cholesteryl ester in HDL from PLTP0 mice compared with control mice. The ability of HDL from LDLr0/PLTP0 and apoBTg/PLTP0 mice to prevent the induction of monocyte chemotactic activity in human artery wall cell cocultures exposed to human LDL was dramatically better than that in controls. Moreover, LDL from PLTP0 mice was markedly resistant to oxidation and induced significantly less monocyte chemotactic activity compared with that in controls. In vitro, PLTP0 HDL removed significantly more oxidized phospholipids from LDL than did control HDL. We conclude that PLTP deficiency improves the anti-inflammatory properties of HDL in mice and reduces the ability of LDL to induce monocyte chemotactic activity.

We isolated HDL and LDL from LDL receptor knockout/PLTP knockout (LDLr0/PLTP0) mice and from apolipoprotein B transgenic (apoBTg)/PLTP0 mice as well as their controls. PLTP0 HDL was relatively rich in protein and depleted in phosphatidylcholine. Turnover studies revealed a 3.5- to 4.0-fold increase in the turnover of protein and cholesteryl ester in HDL from PLTP0 mice compared with control mice. The ability of HDL from LDLr0/PLTP0 and apoBTg/PLTP0 mice to prevent the induction of monocyte chemotactic activity in human artery wall cell cocultures exposed to human LDL was dramatically better than that in controls. Moreover, LDL from PLTP0 mice was markedly resistant to oxidation and induced significantly less monocyte chemotactic activity compared with that in controls. In vitro, PLTP0 HDL removed significantly more oxidized phospholipids from LDL than did control HDL. We conclude that PLTP deficiency improves the anti-inflammatory properties of HDL in mice and reduces the ability of LDL to induce monocyte chemotactic activity.

The expression pattern of cyclins D1 and E, as well as cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p21(Wa1/Cip1) and p27(Kip1) and their relationship to tumour behaviour and patients' prognosis was examined in 142 urothelial cell carcinomas. The expression of these proteins was also analyzed along with other cell-cycle-related proteins such as: p53, pRb and the proliferation-associated indices Ki-67 and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). These molecule markers were localized immunochemically using the monoclonal antibodies anti-cyclin D1 (DCS-6), anti-cyclin E (13A3), anti-p21 (4D10), and anti-p27 (1B4) in 142 patients with urothelial cell carcinoma. Focal positivity (&lt;10% of tumour cells) or the absence of cyclin D1 immunostaining was observed in 105/142 (73.9%) of the tumours. Cyclin D1 expression was correlated with tumour grade and stage as well as with the existence of in situ component. In addition, cyclin D1 expression was positively correlated with p21(Waf1/Cip1) and p27(Kip1) and inversely with the Ki-67 score. Focal positivity (&lt;20% of tumour cells) or the absence of cyclin E immunoreactivity was observed in 105/142 (73.9%) in all cases. Cyclin E expression was correlated with tumour stage. A positive relationship between cyclin E expression and the two associated proliferating indices Ki-67 and PCNA, as well as with p53 and p27(Kip1) proteins expression was noted. Absence or focal positivity (&lt;5% of tumour cells) of p21(Waf1/Cip1) was detected in 88/142 (62%) of the carcinomas. p21(Waf1/Cip1) expression was correlated with tumour grade and stage. A positive relationship of its expression cyclin D1, cyclin E, p27 and pRb expression was observed. Absence or focal immunostaining (&lt;20% of tumour cells) of p27 protein was detected in 55/141 (39%) in all cases. p27(Kip1) expression was correlated with tumour grade as well as with cyclins D1 and E. The prognostic significance of cyclins D1, E and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p21(Waf1/Cip1), p27(Kip1) in determining the risk of recurrence and progression with both univariate (log rank test) and multivariate (Cox regression) methods of analysis showed no statistically significance differences. These findings suggest that the level of the cell cycle regulators studied does not seem to have a clinical value in terms of predicting the risk of early recurrence and progression. In addition the interrelationship probably means their contribution to the regulation of cell growth through different pathways in bladder carcinogenesis.

15263796	Cyclin E	p53	True Positive	Expression patterns of cyclins D1, E and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p21(Waf1/Cip1) and p27(Kip1) in urothelial carcinoma: correlation with other cell-cycle-related proteins (Rb, p53, Ki-67 and PCNA) and clinicopathological features. The expression pattern of cyclins D1 and E, as well as cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p21(Wa1/Cip1) and p27(Kip1) and their relationship to tumour behaviour and patients' prognosis was examined in 142 urothelial cell carcinomas. The expression of these proteins was also analyzed along with other cell-cycle-related proteins such as: p53, pRb and the proliferation-associated indices Ki-67 and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). These molecule markers were localized immunochemically using the monoclonal antibodies anti-cyclin D1 (DCS-6), anti-cyclin E (13A3), anti-p21 (4D10), and anti-p27 (1B4) in 142 patients with urothelial cell carcinoma. Focal positivity (&lt;10% of tumour cells) or the absence of cyclin D1 immunostaining was observed in 105/142 (73.9%) of the tumours. Cyclin D1 expression was correlated with tumour grade and stage as well as with the existence of in situ component. In addition, cyclin D1 expression was positively correlated with p21(Waf1/Cip1) and p27(Kip1) and inversely with the Ki-67 score. Focal positivity (&lt;20% of tumour cells) or the absence of cyclin E immunoreactivity was observed in 105/142 (73.9%) in all cases. Cyclin E expression was correlated with tumour stage. A positive relationship between cyclin E expression and the two associated proliferating indices Ki-67 and PCNA, as well as with p53 and p27(Kip1) proteins expression was noted. Absence or focal positivity (&lt;5% of tumour cells) of p21(Waf1/Cip1) was detected in 88/142 (62%) of the carcinomas. p21(Waf1/Cip1) expression was correlated with tumour grade and stage. A positive relationship of its expression cyclin D1, cyclin E, p27 and pRb expression was observed. Absence or focal immunostaining (&lt;20% of tumour cells) of p27 protein was detected in 55/141 (39%) in all cases. p27(Kip1) expression was correlated with tumour grade as well as with cyclins D1 and E. The prognostic significance of cyclins D1, E and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p21(Waf1/Cip1), p27(Kip1) in determining the risk of recurrence and progression with both univariate (log rank test) and multivariate (Cox regression) methods of analysis showed no statistically significance differences. These findings suggest that the level of the cell cycle regulators studied does not seem to have a clinical value in terms of predicting the risk of early recurrence and progression. In addition the interrelationship probably means their contribution to the regulation of cell growth through different pathways in bladder carcinogenesis.

Focal positivity (&lt;10% of tumour cells) or the absence of cyclin D1 immunostaining was observed in 105/142 (73.9%) of the tumours. Cyclin D1 expression was correlated with tumour grade and stage as well as with the existence of in situ component. In addition, cyclin D1 expression was positively correlated with p21(Waf1/Cip1) and p27(Kip1) and inversely with the Ki-67 score. Focal positivity (&lt;20% of tumour cells) or the absence of cyclin E immunoreactivity was observed in 105/142 (73.9%) in all cases. Cyclin E expression was correlated with tumour stage. A positive relationship between cyclin E expression and the two associated proliferating indices Ki-67 and PCNA, as well as with p53 and p27(Kip1) proteins expression was noted. Absence or focal positivity (&lt;5% of tumour cells) of p21(Waf1/Cip1) was detected in 88/142 (62%) of the carcinomas. p21(Waf1/Cip1) expression was correlated with tumour grade and stage. A positive relationship of its expression cyclin D1, cyclin E, p27 and pRb expression was observed. Absence or focal immunostaining (&lt;20% of tumour cells) of p27 protein was detected in 55/141 (39%) in all cases. p27(Kip1) expression was correlated with tumour grade as well as with cyclins D1 and E. The prognostic significance of cyclins D1, E and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p21(Waf1/Cip1), p27(Kip1) in determining the risk of recurrence and progression with both univariate (log rank test) and multivariate (Cox regression) methods of analysis showed no statistically significance differences. These findings suggest that the level of the cell cycle regulators studied does not seem to have a clinical value in terms of predicting the risk of early recurrence and progression. In addition the interrelationship probably means their contribution to the regulation of cell growth through different pathways in bladder carcinogenesis.

15297375	PDGF	Sp1	True Positive	Ets-1 stimulates platelet-derived growth factor A-chain gene transcription and vascular smooth muscle cell growth via cooperative interactions with Sp1. The platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) family of ligands (composed of A-, B-, C-, and D-chains), potent mitogens, and chemoattractants for cells of mesenchymal origin has been implicated in numerous vascular pathologies involving smooth muscle cell (SMC) hyperplasia. Understanding the molecular mechanisms mediating PDGF transcription would provide new insights into strategies to control PDGF-dependent pathophysiologic processes. We demonstrated previously that PDGF expression is under the positive regulatory influence of Sp1, Sp3, and Egr-1 and is negatively controlled by GCF2, NF-1, and WT-1. In this article, we demonstrate that Ets-1 induces PDGF expression in primary rat aortic SMCs at the level of transcription and mRNA expression. Electrophoretic mobility shift, supershift, and mutational analyses revealed a functional role for the (-555)TTCC(-552) motif in the PDGF promoter that binds endogenous Ets-1. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis showed the interaction of endogenous and exogenous Ets-1 or glutathione S-transferase-tagged Ets-1, bearing only the DNA-binding domain with the authentic PDGF promoter. Conversely, dominant-negative mutant of Ets-1 blocked the promoter interaction of endogenous Ets-1. Overexpression of Ets-1 but not the mutant form of Ets-1 activates the PDGF promoter cooperatively with Sp1. Sp1, which interacts with Ets-1, failed to induce PDGF promoter-dependent expression if the promoter contained a site-specific mutation in this novel Ets-binding site. Small interfering RNA to Ets-1 and Sp1 blocked PDGF and serum-inducible PDGF expression. SMC growth was stimulated by Ets-1 and Sp1 separately and further increased by both factors together. Ets-1-inducible mitogenesis is blocked by antibodies neutralizing PDGF and involves activation of the PDGF alpha-receptor, which binds PDGF. These findings identify a functional cis-acting element for Ets-1 in the PDGF promoter and demonstrate that Sp1 and Ets-1 cooperatively activate PDGF transcription in vascular SMCs.

15297375	PDGF	NF-1	True Positive	Ets-1 stimulates platelet-derived growth factor A-chain gene transcription and vascular smooth muscle cell growth via cooperative interactions with Sp1. The platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) family of ligands (composed of A-, B-, C-, and D-chains), potent mitogens, and chemoattractants for cells of mesenchymal origin has been implicated in numerous vascular pathologies involving smooth muscle cell (SMC) hyperplasia. Understanding the molecular mechanisms mediating PDGF transcription would provide new insights into strategies to control PDGF-dependent pathophysiologic processes. We demonstrated previously that PDGF expression is under the positive regulatory influence of Sp1, Sp3, and Egr-1 and is negatively controlled by GCF2, NF-1, and WT-1. In this article, we demonstrate that Ets-1 induces PDGF expression in primary rat aortic SMCs at the level of transcription and mRNA expression. Electrophoretic mobility shift, supershift, and mutational analyses revealed a functional role for the (-555)TTCC(-552) motif in the PDGF promoter that binds endogenous Ets-1. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis showed the interaction of endogenous and exogenous Ets-1 or glutathione S-transferase-tagged Ets-1, bearing only the DNA-binding domain with the authentic PDGF promoter. Conversely, dominant-negative mutant of Ets-1 blocked the promoter interaction of endogenous Ets-1. Overexpression of Ets-1 but not the mutant form of Ets-1 activates the PDGF promoter cooperatively with Sp1. Sp1, which interacts with Ets-1, failed to induce PDGF promoter-dependent expression if the promoter contained a site-specific mutation in this novel Ets-binding site. Small interfering RNA to Ets-1 and Sp1 blocked PDGF and serum-inducible PDGF expression. SMC growth was stimulated by Ets-1 and Sp1 separately and further increased by both factors together. Ets-1-inducible mitogenesis is blocked by antibodies neutralizing PDGF and involves activation of the PDGF alpha-receptor, which binds PDGF. These findings identify a functional cis-acting element for Ets-1 in the PDGF promoter and demonstrate that Sp1 and Ets-1 cooperatively activate PDGF transcription in vascular SMCs.

Conversely, dominant-negative mutant of Ets-1 blocked the promoter interaction of endogenous Ets-1. Overexpression of Ets-1 but not the mutant form of Ets-1 activates the PDGF promoter cooperatively with Sp1. Sp1, which interacts with Ets-1, failed to induce PDGF promoter-dependent expression if the promoter contained a site-specific mutation in this novel Ets-binding site. Small interfering RNA to Ets-1 and Sp1 blocked PDGF and serum-inducible PDGF expression. SMC growth was stimulated by Ets-1 and Sp1 separately and further increased by both factors together. Ets-1-inducible mitogenesis is blocked by antibodies neutralizing PDGF and involves activation of the PDGF alpha-receptor, which binds PDGF. These findings identify a functional cis-acting element for Ets-1 in the PDGF promoter and demonstrate that Sp1 and Ets-1 cooperatively activate PDGF transcription in vascular SMCs.
15297375	Egr-1	WT-1	True Negative	Ets-1 stimulates platelet-derived growth factor A-chain gene transcription and vascular smooth muscle cell growth via cooperative interactions with Sp1. The platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) family of ligands (composed of A-, B-, C-, and D-chains), potent mitogens, and chemoattractants for cells of mesenchymal origin has been implicated in numerous vascular pathologies involving smooth muscle cell (SMC) hyperplasia. Understanding the molecular mechanisms mediating PDGF transcription would provide new insights into strategies to control PDGF-dependent pathophysiologic processes. We demonstrated previously that PDGF expression is under the positive regulatory influence of Sp1, Sp3, and Egr-1 and is negatively controlled by GCF2, NF-1, and WT-1. In this article, we demonstrate that Ets-1 induces PDGF expression in primary rat aortic SMCs at the level of transcription and mRNA expression.

15307176	CD46	CD3	True Positive	CD46 mediated costimulation induces a Th1 biased response and enhances early TCR CD3 signaling in human CD4+ T lymphocytes. The role of membrane cofactor protein (MCP, CD46) on human T cell activation has been analyzed. Coligation of CD3 and CD46 in the presence of PMA or CD28 costimuli enhanced IL-2, IFN-gamma, or IL-10 secretion by CD4+ T lymphocytes. The effect of CD46 on IL-10 secretion did not require additional costimuli like anti-CD28 antibodies or phorbol esters. CD46 also enhanced IL-2 or IFN-gamma secretion by CD4+ blasts. In contrast, IL-5 secretion was inhibited upon CD46 CD3 coligation, in all the cells analyzed. These effects were independent of IL-12 and suggest that CD46 costimulation promotes a Th1-biased response in human CD4+ T lymphocytes. CD46 enhanced TCR CD3 induced tyrosine phosphorylation of CD3zeta and ZAP-70, as well as the activation of the ERK, JNK, and p38, but did not modify intracellular calcium. The effect of specific inhibitors shows that enhanced ERK activation contributes to augmented IFN-gamma and lower IL-5 secretion and, consequently, to the Th1 bias. Cross-linking CD46 alone induced weak tyrosine phosphorylation of CD3zeta and ZAP-70. However, CD46 cross-linking by itself did not induce cell proliferation or lymphokine secretion, and pretreatment of CD4+ T lymphocytes with anti-CD46 antibodies did not significantly alter TCR CD3 activation.

These effects were independent of IL-12 and suggest that CD46 costimulation promotes a Th1-biased response in human CD4+ T lymphocytes. CD46 enhanced TCR CD3 induced tyrosine phosphorylation of CD3zeta and ZAP-70, as well as the activation of the ERK, JNK, and p38, but did not modify intracellular calcium. The effect of specific inhibitors shows that enhanced ERK activation contributes to augmented IFN-gamma and lower IL-5 secretion and, consequently, to the Th1 bias. Cross-linking CD46 alone induced weak tyrosine phosphorylation of CD3zeta and ZAP-70. However, CD46 cross-linking by itself did not induce cell proliferation or lymphokine secretion, and pretreatment of CD4+ T lymphocytes with anti-CD46 antibodies did not significantly alter TCR CD3 activation.

In contrast, IL-5 secretion was inhibited upon CD46 CD3 coligation, in all the cells analyzed. These effects were independent of IL-12 and suggest that CD46 costimulation promotes a Th1-biased response in human CD4+ T lymphocytes. CD46 enhanced TCR CD3 induced tyrosine phosphorylation of CD3zeta and ZAP-70, as well as the activation of the ERK, JNK, and p38, but did not modify intracellular calcium. The effect of specific inhibitors shows that enhanced ERK activation contributes to augmented IFN-gamma and lower IL-5 secretion and, consequently, to the Th1 bias. Cross-linking CD46 alone induced weak tyrosine phosphorylation of CD3zeta and ZAP-70. However, CD46 cross-linking by itself did not induce cell proliferation or lymphokine secretion, and pretreatment of CD4+ T lymphocytes with anti-CD46 antibodies did not significantly alter TCR CD3 activation.

The effect of CD46 on IL-10 secretion did not require additional costimuli like anti-CD28 antibodies or phorbol esters. CD46 also enhanced IL-2 or IFN-gamma secretion by CD4+ blasts. In contrast, IL-5 secretion was inhibited upon CD46 CD3 coligation, in all the cells analyzed. These effects were independent of IL-12 and suggest that CD46 costimulation promotes a Th1-biased response in human CD4+ T lymphocytes. CD46 enhanced TCR CD3 induced tyrosine phosphorylation of CD3zeta and ZAP-70, as well as the activation of the ERK, JNK, and p38, but did not modify intracellular calcium. The effect of specific inhibitors shows that enhanced ERK activation contributes to augmented IFN-gamma and lower IL-5 secretion and, consequently, to the Th1 bias. Cross-linking CD46 alone induced weak tyrosine phosphorylation of CD3zeta and ZAP-70. However, CD46 cross-linking by itself did not induce cell proliferation or lymphokine secretion, and pretreatment of CD4+ T lymphocytes with anti-CD46 antibodies did not significantly alter TCR CD3 activation.

Coligation of CD3 and CD46 in the presence of PMA or CD28 costimuli enhanced IL-2, IFN-gamma, or IL-10 secretion by CD4+ T lymphocytes. The effect of CD46 on IL-10 secretion did not require additional costimuli like anti-CD28 antibodies or phorbol esters. CD46 also enhanced IL-2 or IFN-gamma secretion by CD4+ blasts. In contrast, IL-5 secretion was inhibited upon CD46 CD3 coligation, in all the cells analyzed. These effects were independent of IL-12 and suggest that CD46 costimulation promotes a Th1-biased response in human CD4+ T lymphocytes. CD46 enhanced TCR CD3 induced tyrosine phosphorylation of CD3zeta and ZAP-70, as well as the activation of the ERK, JNK, and p38, but did not modify intracellular calcium. The effect of specific inhibitors shows that enhanced ERK activation contributes to augmented IFN-gamma and lower IL-5 secretion and, consequently, to the Th1 bias. Cross-linking CD46 alone induced weak tyrosine phosphorylation of CD3zeta and ZAP-70. However, CD46 cross-linking by itself did not induce cell proliferation or lymphokine secretion, and pretreatment of CD4+ T lymphocytes with anti-CD46 antibodies did not significantly alter TCR CD3 activation.

15309723	PDGF	IL-10	True Negative	Effects of platelet-derived growth factor and interleukin-10 on Fas/Fas-ligand and Bcl-2/Bax mRNA expression in rat hepatic stellate cells in vitro. To investigate the effects of platelet-derived growth factor(PDGF) and interleukin-10 (IL-10) on Fas/Fas-ligand and Bcl-2/Bax mRNA expressions in rat hepatic stellate cells. Rat hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) were isolated and purified from rat liver by in situ digestion of collagenase and pronase and single-step density Nycodenz gradient. After activated by culture in vitro, HSCs were divided into 4 groups and treated with nothing (group N), PDGF (group P), IL-10 (group I) and PDGF in combination with IL-10 (group C), respectively. Semi-quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis was employed to compare the mRNA expression levels of Fas/FasL and Bcl-2/Bax in HSCs of each group. The expression levels of Fas between the 4 groups had no significant differences (P&gt;0.05). FasL mRNA level in normal culture-activated HSCs (group N) was very low. It increased obviously after HSCs were treated with IL-10 (group I) (0.091+/-0.007 vs 0.385+/-0.051, P&lt;0.01), but remained the low level after treated with PDGF alone (group P) or PDGF in combination with IL-10 (group C). Contrast to the control group, after treated with PDGF and IL-10, either alone or in combination, Bcl-2 mRNA expression was down-regulated and Bax mRNA expression was up-regulated, both following the turn from group P, group I to group C. Expression of Bcl-2 mRNA in group C was significantly lower than that in group P (0.126+/-0.008 vs 0.210+/-0.024, P&lt;0.01). But no significant difference was found between group C and group I, as well as between group I and group P (P&gt;0.05). Similarly, the expression of Bax in group C was higher than that in group P (0.513+/-0.016 vs 0.400+/-0.022, P&lt;0.01). No significant difference was found between group I and group P (P&gt;0.05). But compared with group C, Bax expressions in group I tended to decrease (0.449+/-0.028 vs 0.513+/-0.016, P&lt;0.05). PDGF may promote proliferation of HSCs but is neutral with respect to HSC apoptosis. IL-10 may promote the apoptosis of HSCs by up-regulating the expressions of FasL and Bax and down-regulating the expression of Bcl-2, which may be involved in its antifibrosis mechanism.

Rat hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) were isolated and purified from rat liver by in situ digestion of collagenase and pronase and single-step density Nycodenz gradient. After activated by culture in vitro, HSCs were divided into 4 groups and treated with nothing (group N), PDGF (group P), IL-10 (group I) and PDGF in combination with IL-10 (group C), respectively. Semi-quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis was employed to compare the mRNA expression levels of Fas/FasL and Bcl-2/Bax in HSCs of each group. The expression levels of Fas between the 4 groups had no significant differences (P&gt;0.05). FasL mRNA level in normal culture-activated HSCs (group N) was very low. It increased obviously after HSCs were treated with IL-10 (group I) (0.091+/-0.007 vs 0.385+/-0.051, P&lt;0.01), but remained the low level after treated with PDGF alone (group P) or PDGF in combination with IL-10 (group C). Contrast to the control group, after treated with PDGF and IL-10, either alone or in combination, Bcl-2 mRNA expression was down-regulated and Bax mRNA expression was up-regulated, both following the turn from group P, group I to group C. Expression of Bcl-2 mRNA in group C was significantly lower than that in group P (0.126+/-0.008 vs 0.210+/-0.024, P&lt;0.01). But no significant difference was found between group C and group I, as well as between group I and group P (P&gt;0.05). Similarly, the expression of Bax in group C was higher than that in group P (0.513+/-0.016 vs 0.400+/-0.022, P&lt;0.01). No significant difference was found between group I and group P (P&gt;0.05). But compared with group C, Bax expressions in group I tended to decrease (0.449+/-0.028 vs 0.513+/-0.016, P&lt;0.05). PDGF may promote proliferation of HSCs but is neutral with respect to HSC apoptosis. IL-10 may promote the apoptosis of HSCs by up-regulating the expressions of FasL and Bax and down-regulating the expression of Bcl-2, which may be involved in its antifibrosis mechanism.

The expression levels of Fas between the 4 groups had no significant differences (P&gt;0.05). FasL mRNA level in normal culture-activated HSCs (group N) was very low. It increased obviously after HSCs were treated with IL-10 (group I) (0.091+/-0.007 vs 0.385+/-0.051, P&lt;0.01), but remained the low level after treated with PDGF alone (group P) or PDGF in combination with IL-10 (group C). Contrast to the control group, after treated with PDGF and IL-10, either alone or in combination, Bcl-2 mRNA expression was down-regulated and Bax mRNA expression was up-regulated, both following the turn from group P, group I to group C. Expression of Bcl-2 mRNA in group C was significantly lower than that in group P (0.126+/-0.008 vs 0.210+/-0.024, P&lt;0.01). But no significant difference was found between group C and group I, as well as between group I and group P (P&gt;0.05). Similarly, the expression of Bax in group C was higher than that in group P (0.513+/-0.016 vs 0.400+/-0.022, P&lt;0.01). No significant difference was found between group I and group P (P&gt;0.05). But compared with group C, Bax expressions in group I tended to decrease (0.449+/-0.028 vs 0.513+/-0.016, P&lt;0.05). PDGF may promote proliferation of HSCs but is neutral with respect to HSC apoptosis. IL-10 may promote the apoptosis of HSCs by up-regulating the expressions of FasL and Bax and down-regulating the expression of Bcl-2, which may be involved in its antifibrosis mechanism.

To investigate the effects of platelet-derived growth factor(PDGF) and interleukin-10 (IL-10) on Fas/Fas-ligand and Bcl-2/Bax mRNA expressions in rat hepatic stellate cells.

15319285	GILZ	Bcl-xL	True Positive	Decrease of Bcl-xL and augmentation of thymocyte apoptosis in GILZ overexpressing transgenic mice. Glucocorticoids promote thymocyte apoptosis and modulate transcription of numerous genes. GILZ (glucocorticoid-induced leucine zipper), being one of them, is strongly up-regulated in the thymus. To elucidate its function we generated transgenic mice overexpressing it specifically in the T-cell lineage and characterized its influence on thymus function. In young adult transgenic mice CD4(+)CD8(+) thymocyte number was significantly decreased and ex vivo thymocyte apoptosis was increased. Apoptotic pathway analysis detected reduced antiapoptotic B-cell leukemia XL (Bcl-xL) expression and increased activation of caspase-8 and caspase-3. Time-course experiments showed that in wild-type (WT) thymocytes GILZ up-regulation was followed by sequential Bcl-xL decreased expression and activation of caspase-8 and of caspase-3. Moreover, GILZ delivered inside WT thymocytes by a fusion protein with the transactivator of transcription (TAT) peptide decreased Bcl-xL and promoted their apoptosis. In aged mice perturbation of thymic subset numbers was amplified over time, as demonstrated by a further decrease in CD4(+)CD8(+) cells and increases in CD4(+)CD8(-), CD4(-)CD8(-), and CD8(+)CD4(-) cell counts. These results support the hypothesis that GILZ participates in the regulation of thymocyte apoptosis by glucocorticoids.

15319299	COX-2	ERK	True Positive	Nicotine promotes gastric tumor growth and neovascularization by activating extracellular signal-regulated kinase and cyclooxygenase-2. Early studies revealed that cigarette smoke promotes gastric cancer growth through the induction of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). Nicotine, one of the active ingredients in cigarette smoke, has detrimental effects in the stomach. To date, there is no direct evidence to validate the effect of nicotine on gastric tumor growth and its carcinogenic mechanism(s). We therefore investigated whether nicotine could promote tumor growth and neovascularization in vivo, and the biological mechanism(s) in connection with the signaling cascade involving COX-2 and extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK). Athymic nude mice, with gastric cancer cells (AGS) orthotopically implanted into the gastric wall, treated with nicotine (50 or 200 microg/ml) in their drinking water for 3 months developed larger tumor areas than mice in the control group. Nicotine further increased proliferating cellular nuclear antigen (PCNA) staining and microvessel density by 70 and 30%, respectively, with concomitant activation of ERK phosphorylation, COX-2 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression in the tumors. Intraperitoneal administration of a selective COX-2 inhibitor (SC-236, 2 mg/kg) prevented the nicotine-induced tumor growth and neovascularization dose-dependently. Consistent with our animal model, an in vitro study also demonstrated that incubation with nicotine (50-200 microg/ml) for 5 h stimulated cell proliferation dose-dependently and increased COX-2 expression, prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) and VEGF release, as well as activation of ERK phosphorylation. Pre-treatment with specific mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitors (U0126 or PD98059) attenuated COX-2 expression and subsequent PGE(2) release by nicotine. Furthermore, the stimulatory action of nicotine on cancer cell growth and angiogenic factor VEGF production was suppressed by inhibitors of MEK (U0126) and COX-2 (SC-236). These findings reveal a direct promoting action of nicotine on the growth of gastric tumor and neovascularization through sequential activation of the ERK/COX-2/VEGF signaling pathway, which can be targeted for chemoprevention of gastric cancer, particularly in cigarette smokers.

Early studies revealed that cigarette smoke promotes gastric cancer growth through the induction of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). Nicotine, one of the active ingredients in cigarette smoke, has detrimental effects in the stomach. To date, there is no direct evidence to validate the effect of nicotine on gastric tumor growth and its carcinogenic mechanism(s). We therefore investigated whether nicotine could promote tumor growth and neovascularization in vivo, and the biological mechanism(s) in connection with the signaling cascade involving COX-2 and extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK). Athymic nude mice, with gastric cancer cells (AGS) orthotopically implanted into the gastric wall, treated with nicotine (50 or 200 microg/ml) in their drinking water for 3 months developed larger tumor areas than mice in the control group. Nicotine further increased proliferating cellular nuclear antigen (PCNA) staining and microvessel density by 70 and 30%, respectively, with concomitant activation of ERK phosphorylation, COX-2 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression in the tumors. Intraperitoneal administration of a selective COX-2 inhibitor (SC-236, 2 mg/kg) prevented the nicotine-induced tumor growth and neovascularization dose-dependently. Consistent with our animal model, an in vitro study also demonstrated that incubation with nicotine (50-200 microg/ml) for 5 h stimulated cell proliferation dose-dependently and increased COX-2 expression, prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) and VEGF release, as well as activation of ERK phosphorylation. Pre-treatment with specific mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitors (U0126 or PD98059) attenuated COX-2 expression and subsequent PGE(2) release by nicotine. Furthermore, the stimulatory action of nicotine on cancer cell growth and angiogenic factor VEGF production was suppressed by inhibitors of MEK (U0126) and COX-2 (SC-236). These findings reveal a direct promoting action of nicotine on the growth of gastric tumor and neovascularization through sequential activation of the ERK/COX-2/VEGF signaling pathway, which can be targeted for chemoprevention of gastric cancer, particularly in cigarette smokers.

22504285	XBP-1	HMGB1	True Positive	Endoplasmic reticulum stress and its regulator XBP-1 contributes to dendritic cell maturation and activation induced by high mobility group box-1 protein. High mobility group box-1 protein (HMGB1) had been proved to induce maturation and activation of dendritic cell (DC), however, the endogenous changes and mechanisms underlying are unknown. Since endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) activates an adaptive unfolded protein response (UPR) that facilitates cellular survival and repair, we hypothesized that HMGB1 may regulate the function of DC by modulating ERS. In our study, HMGB1 stimulation induced significant ERS responses in DCs in a time- and dose-dependent manner, demonstrated by the up-regulation of a number of ERS markers. Gene silence of XBP-1 in splenic DCs decreased the levels of CD80, CD86 as well as major histocompatibility complex MHC-II expression and cytokine secretion after HMGB1 treatment, when compared with untransfected or nontargeting-transfected DCs (all P&lt;0.05). Moreover, XBP-1 silenced DCs after treatment with HMGB1 failed to stimulate notable proliferation and differentiation of T cells, unlike normal DCs or nontargeting-transfected DCs (all P&lt;0.05). Gene silence of XBP-1 resulted in down-regulation of the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) expression on the surface of splenic DCs induced by HMGB1 stimulation (P&lt;0.05). These findings demonstrate an important role for ERS and its regulator XBP-1 in HMGB1-induced maturation and activation of DCs.

Gene silence of XBP-1 in splenic DCs decreased the levels of CD80, CD86 as well as major histocompatibility complex MHC-II expression and cytokine secretion after HMGB1 treatment, when compared with untransfected or nontargeting-transfected DCs (all P&lt;0.05). Moreover, XBP-1 silenced DCs after treatment with HMGB1 failed to stimulate notable proliferation and differentiation of T cells, unlike normal DCs or nontargeting-transfected DCs (all P&lt;0.05). Gene silence of XBP-1 resulted in down-regulation of the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) expression on the surface of splenic DCs induced by HMGB1 stimulation (P&lt;0.05). These findings demonstrate an important role for ERS and its regulator XBP-1 in HMGB1-induced maturation and activation of DCs.
22516229	FSH	GDF-9	True Positive	GDF-9 and bFGF enhance the effect of FSH on the survival, activation, and growth of cattle primordial follicles. This study aims to investigate the effects of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) in combination with growth and differentiation factor-9 (GDF-9) or basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) on the activation, survival and growth of cattle primordial follicles. Ovarian tissues were cultured for 3, 7, 14, 22 days in &#x3b1; minimum essential medium (&#x3b1;-MEM) supplemented with FSH, FSH+GDF-9 or FSH+bFGF. Non-cultured and cultured ovarian fragments were processed for histological and TUNEL analysis. Compared to the FSH medium, the results showed FSH+GDF-9 medium increased the percentage of primary follicles in all culture periods and secondary follicles after 14 days of culture (P&lt;0.05), meanwhile the diameter of primary and secondary follicles were also observed to increase in this medium after 7 days of cultures (P&lt;0.05). FSH+bFGF medium appeared to increase the percentage of primary follicles after 14 days of culture and secondary follicles at day 14 of culture than FSH medium (P&lt;0.05). Furthermore, the FSH+GDF-9 and FSH+bFGF mediums had a greater percentage of normal follicles, and lesser apoptotic cell rates than FSH medium. The results first indicated that FSH in combination with GDF-9 or bFGF can improve the survival, activation, and growth of cattle primordial follicles after the long-term culture of ovarian cortex.

26525587	TLR9	S100A8	True Positive	Increased expression of TLR9 associated with pro-inflammatory S100A8 and IL-8 in diabetic wounds could lead to unresolved inflammation in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) cases with impaired wound healing. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is characterized by persistent hyperglycemia which causes a chain of abrupt biochemical and physiological changes. Immune dys-regulation is the hallmark of T2DM that could contribute to prolonged inflammation causing transformation of wounds into non-healing chronic ulcers. Toll like receptor -9 (TLR9) is a major receptor involved in innate immune regulation. TLR9 activation induces release of pro-inflammatory molecules like S100A8 and interleukin-8 (IL-8) by myeloid cells causing migration of myeloid cells to the site of inflammation. We hypothesized that pro-inflammatory S100A8 and IL-8 proteins could cause persistent inflammation in chronic wounds like diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) and may contribute to impaired wound healing in T2DM patients. Expression of TLR9 and its downstream effector molecules S100A8, and IL-8 were analyzed in chronic diabetic wound and non-diabetic control wound tissue samples by semiquantitative reverse transcriptase - polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), quantitative RT-PCR, western blot and immunofluorescence. CD11b(+)CD33(+) myeloid cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. TLR9 message and protein were higher in diabetic wounds compared to control wounds (p=0.03, t=2.21 for TLR9 mRNA; p=&lt;0.001, t=4.21 for TLR9 protein). TLR9 down-stream effector molecules S100A8 and IL-8 were also increased in diabetic wounds (p=0.003, t=3.1 for S100A8 mRNA; p=0.04, t=2.04 for IL-8). CD11b(+) CD33(+) myeloid cells were decreased in T2DM as compared to non-diabetic controls (p=0.001, t=3.6). DFU subjects had higher levels of CD11b(+) CD33(+) myeloid cells as compared to non-DFU T2DM control (p=0.003, t=2.8). Infection in the wound microenvironment could be the cause of increase in CD11b(+)CD33(+) myeloid cells in DFU (p=0.03, t=2.5). The up-regulation of myeloid cell-derived pro-inflammatory molecules S100A8 and IL-8 in combination with lower levels of CD11b(+) CD33(+) myeloid cells may cause the impairment of wound healing in T2DM subjects leading to chronic ulcers.

26812075	FXR	NR0B2	True Positive	Gene expression profiling in human precision cut liver slices in response to the FXR agonist obeticholic acid. The bile acid-activated farnesoid X receptor (FXR) is a nuclear receptor regulating bile acid, glucose and cholesterol homeostasis. Obeticholic acid (OCA), a promising drug for the treatment of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and type 2 diabetes, activates FXR. Mouse studies demonstrated that FXR activation by OCA alters hepatic expression of many genes. However, no data are available on the effects of OCA in the human liver. Here we generated gene expression profiles in human precision cut liver slices (hPCLS) after treatment with OCA. hPCLS were incubated with OCA for 24 h. Wild-type or FXR(-/-) mice received OCA or vehicle by oral gavage for 7 days. Transcriptomic analysis showed that well-known FXR target genes, including NR0B2 (SHP), ABCB11 (BSEP), SLC51A (OST&#x3b1;) and SLC51B (OST&#x3b2;), and ABCB4 (MDR3) are regulated by OCA in hPCLS. Ingenuity pathway analysis confirmed that 'FXR/RXR activation' is the most significantly changed pathway upon OCA treatment. Comparison of gene expression profiles in hPCLS and mouse livers identified 18 common potential FXR targets. ChIP-sequencing in mouse liver confirmed FXR binding to IR1 sequences of AKAP13, CGNL1, DYRK3, PDIA5, PPP1R3B and TBX6. Our study shows that hPCLS respond to OCA treatment by upregulating well-known FXR target genes, demonstrating its suitability to study FXR-mediated gene regulation. We identified six novel bona-fide FXR target genes in both mouse and human liver. Finally, we discuss a possible explanation for changes in high or low density lipoprotein observed in NASH and primary biliary cholangitis patients treated with OCA based on the genomic expression profile in hPCLS.

Finally, we discuss a possible explanation for changes in high or low density lipoprotein observed in NASH and primary biliary cholangitis patients treated with OCA based on the genomic expression profile in hPCLS.
26812075	FXR	TBX6	True Positive	Gene expression profiling in human precision cut liver slices in response to the FXR agonist obeticholic acid. The bile acid-activated farnesoid X receptor (FXR) is a nuclear receptor regulating bile acid, glucose and cholesterol homeostasis. Obeticholic acid (OCA), a promising drug for the treatment of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and type 2 diabetes, activates FXR. Mouse studies demonstrated that FXR activation by OCA alters hepatic expression of many genes. However, no data are available on the effects of OCA in the human liver. Here we generated gene expression profiles in human precision cut liver slices (hPCLS) after treatment with OCA. hPCLS were incubated with OCA for 24 h. Wild-type or FXR(-/-) mice received OCA or vehicle by oral gavage for 7 days. Transcriptomic analysis showed that well-known FXR target genes, including NR0B2 (SHP), ABCB11 (BSEP), SLC51A (OST&#x3b1;) and SLC51B (OST&#x3b2;), and ABCB4 (MDR3) are regulated by OCA in hPCLS. Ingenuity pathway analysis confirmed that 'FXR/RXR activation' is the most significantly changed pathway upon OCA treatment. Comparison of gene expression profiles in hPCLS and mouse livers identified 18 common potential FXR targets. ChIP-sequencing in mouse liver confirmed FXR binding to IR1 sequences of AKAP13, CGNL1, DYRK3, PDIA5, PPP1R3B and TBX6.

Transcriptomic analysis showed that well-known FXR target genes, including NR0B2 (SHP), ABCB11 (BSEP), SLC51A (OST&#x3b1;) and SLC51B (OST&#x3b2;), and ABCB4 (MDR3) are regulated by OCA in hPCLS. Ingenuity pathway analysis confirmed that 'FXR/RXR activation' is the most significantly changed pathway upon OCA treatment. Comparison of gene expression profiles in hPCLS and mouse livers identified 18 common potential FXR targets. ChIP-sequencing in mouse liver confirmed FXR binding to IR1 sequences of AKAP13, CGNL1, DYRK3, PDIA5, PPP1R3B and TBX6. Our study shows that hPCLS respond to OCA treatment by upregulating well-known FXR target genes, demonstrating its suitability to study FXR-mediated gene regulation. We identified six novel bona-fide FXR target genes in both mouse and human liver. Finally, we discuss a possible explanation for changes in high or low density lipoprotein observed in NASH and primary biliary cholangitis patients treated with OCA based on the genomic expression profile in hPCLS.

26812075	SLC51B	PPP1R3B	True Negative	Gene expression profiling in human precision cut liver slices in response to the FXR agonist obeticholic acid. The bile acid-activated farnesoid X receptor (FXR) is a nuclear receptor regulating bile acid, glucose and cholesterol homeostasis. Obeticholic acid (OCA), a promising drug for the treatment of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and type 2 diabetes, activates FXR. Mouse studies demonstrated that FXR activation by OCA alters hepatic expression of many genes. However, no data are available on the effects of OCA in the human liver. Here we generated gene expression profiles in human precision cut liver slices (hPCLS) after treatment with OCA. hPCLS were incubated with OCA for 24 h. Wild-type or FXR(-/-) mice received OCA or vehicle by oral gavage for 7 days. Transcriptomic analysis showed that well-known FXR target genes, including NR0B2 (SHP), ABCB11 (BSEP), SLC51A (OST&#x3b1;) and SLC51B (OST&#x3b2;), and ABCB4 (MDR3) are regulated by OCA in hPCLS. Ingenuity pathway analysis confirmed that 'FXR/RXR activation' is the most significantly changed pathway upon OCA treatment. Comparison of gene expression profiles in hPCLS and mouse livers identified 18 common potential FXR targets. ChIP-sequencing in mouse liver confirmed FXR binding to IR1 sequences of AKAP13, CGNL1, DYRK3, PDIA5, PPP1R3B and TBX6. Our study shows that hPCLS respond to OCA treatment by upregulating well-known FXR target genes, demonstrating its suitability to study FXR-mediated gene regulation. We identified six novel bona-fide FXR target genes in both mouse and human liver. Finally, we discuss a possible explanation for changes in high or low density lipoprotein observed in NASH and primary biliary cholangitis patients treated with OCA based on the genomic expression profile in hPCLS.

Ingenuity pathway analysis confirmed that 'FXR/RXR activation' is the most significantly changed pathway upon OCA treatment. Comparison of gene expression profiles in hPCLS and mouse livers identified 18 common potential FXR targets. ChIP-sequencing in mouse liver confirmed FXR binding to IR1 sequences of AKAP13, CGNL1, DYRK3, PDIA5, PPP1R3B and TBX6. Our study shows that hPCLS respond to OCA treatment by upregulating well-known FXR target genes, demonstrating its suitability to study FXR-mediated gene regulation. We identified six novel bona-fide FXR target genes in both mouse and human liver. Finally, we discuss a possible explanation for changes in high or low density lipoprotein observed in NASH and primary biliary cholangitis patients treated with OCA based on the genomic expression profile in hPCLS.

27100621	Akh	AHR	True Negative	Dibutyl Phthalate Exposure Disrupts Evolutionarily Conserved Insulin and Glucagon-Like Signaling in Drosophila Males. Phthalate diesters are commonly used as industrial plasticisers, as well as in cosmetics and skin care products, as a result people are constantly exposed to these xenobiotics. Recent epidemiological studies have found a correlation between circulating phthalate levels and type 2 diabetes, whereas animal studies indicate that phthalates are capable of disrupting endocrine signaling. Nonetheless, how phthalates interfere with metabolic function is still unclear. Here, we show that feeding Drosophila males the xenobiotic dibutyl phthalate (DBP) affects conserved insulin- and glucagon-like signaling. We report that raising flies on food containing DBP leads to starvation resistance, increased lipid storage, hyperglycemia, and hyperphagia. We go on to show that the starvation-resistance phenotype can be rescued by overexpression of the glucagon analogue adipokinetic hormone Akh. Furthermore, although acute DBP exposure in adult flies is able to affect insulin levels, only chronic feeding influences Akh expression. We establish that raising flies on DBP-containing food or feeding adults DBP food affects the expression of homologous genes involved in xenobiotic and lipid metabolism (AHR [Drosophila ss], NR1I2 [Hr96], ABCB1 [MDR50], ABCC3 [MRP], and CYP3A4 [Cyp9f2]). Finally, we determined that the expression of these genes is also influenced by Akh. Our results provide comprehensive evidence that DBP can disrupt metabolism in Drosophila males, by regulating genes involved in glucose, lipid, and xenobiotic metabolism.

Phthalate diesters are commonly used as industrial plasticisers, as well as in cosmetics and skin care products, as a result people are constantly exposed to these xenobiotics. Recent epidemiological studies have found a correlation between circulating phthalate levels and type 2 diabetes, whereas animal studies indicate that phthalates are capable of disrupting endocrine signaling. Nonetheless, how phthalates interfere with metabolic function is still unclear. Here, we show that feeding Drosophila males the xenobiotic dibutyl phthalate (DBP) affects conserved insulin- and glucagon-like signaling. We report that raising flies on food containing DBP leads to starvation resistance, increased lipid storage, hyperglycemia, and hyperphagia. We go on to show that the starvation-resistance phenotype can be rescued by overexpression of the glucagon analogue adipokinetic hormone Akh. Furthermore, although acute DBP exposure in adult flies is able to affect insulin levels, only chronic feeding influences Akh expression. We establish that raising flies on DBP-containing food or feeding adults DBP food affects the expression of homologous genes involved in xenobiotic and lipid metabolism (AHR [Drosophila ss], NR1I2 [Hr96], ABCB1 [MDR50], ABCC3 [MRP], and CYP3A4 [Cyp9f2]). Finally, we determined that the expression of these genes is also influenced by Akh. Our results provide comprehensive evidence that DBP can disrupt metabolism in Drosophila males, by regulating genes involved in glucose, lipid, and xenobiotic metabolism.

27551309	TCF7L2	HHEX	True Negative	Several type 2 diabetes-associated variants in genes annotated to WNT signaling interact with dietary fiber in relation to incidence of type 2 diabetes. TCF7L2 is a central transcription factor in the canonical wingless-type MMTV integration site (WNT) signaling pathway, and genetic variants in TCF7L2 have been found to interact with dietary fiber intake on type 2 diabetes risk. Here, we investigate whether other type 2 diabetes genes could be involved in the WNT signaling pathway and whether variants in such genes might interact with dietary fiber on type 2 diabetes incidence. We included 26,905 individuals without diabetes from the Malm&#xf6; Diet and Cancer Study cohort. Diet data was collected at baseline using a food frequency questionnaire, a 7-day food record, and an interview. Altogether, 51 gene loci were analyzed for putative links to WNT signaling. Over a mean follow-up period of 14.7&#xa0;years, 3132 incident cases of type 2 diabetes were recorded. Seven genes (nine single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)) were annotated as involved in WNT signaling including TCF7L2 (rs7903146 and rs12255372), HHEX (rs1111875), HNF1A (rs7957197), NOTCH2 (rs10923931), TLE4 (rs13292136), ZBED3 (rs4457053), and PPARG (rs1801282 and rs13081389). SNPs in TCF7L2, NOTCH2, and ZBED3 showed significant interactions with fiber intake on type 2 diabetes incidence (P interaction&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.034, 0.005, 0.017, and 0.002, respectively). The magnitude of the association between the TCF7L2 risk allele and incident type 2 diabetes increased from the lowest to the highest quintiles of fiber intake. Higher fiber associated with lower type 2 diabetes risk only among risk allele carriers of the NOTCH2 variant and homozygotes of the risk allele of the ZBED3 variant. Our results suggest that several type 2 diabetes susceptibility SNPs in genes involved in WNT signaling may interact with dietary fiber intake on type 2 diabetes incidence.

The magnitude of the association between the TCF7L2 risk allele and incident type 2 diabetes increased from the lowest to the highest quintiles of fiber intake. Higher fiber associated with lower type 2 diabetes risk only among risk allele carriers of the NOTCH2 variant and homozygotes of the risk allele of the ZBED3 variant. Our results suggest that several type 2 diabetes susceptibility SNPs in genes involved in WNT signaling may interact with dietary fiber intake on type 2 diabetes incidence.
27551309	HNF1A	PPARG	True Negative	Several type 2 diabetes-associated variants in genes annotated to WNT signaling interact with dietary fiber in relation to incidence of type 2 diabetes. TCF7L2 is a central transcription factor in the canonical wingless-type MMTV integration site (WNT) signaling pathway, and genetic variants in TCF7L2 have been found to interact with dietary fiber intake on type 2 diabetes risk. Here, we investigate whether other type 2 diabetes genes could be involved in the WNT signaling pathway and whether variants in such genes might interact with dietary fiber on type 2 diabetes incidence. We included 26,905 individuals without diabetes from the Malm&#xf6; Diet and Cancer Study cohort. Diet data was collected at baseline using a food frequency questionnaire, a 7-day food record, and an interview. Altogether, 51 gene loci were analyzed for putative links to WNT signaling.

30445175	IL-6	IL-10	True Negative	A four-strain probiotic exerts positive immunomodulatory effects by enhancing colonic butyrate production in vitro. Poorly formulated probiotic supplements intended for oral administration often fail to protect bacteria from the challenges of human digestion, meaning bacteria do not reach the small intestine in a viable state. As a result, the ability of probiotics to influence the human gut microbiota has not been proven. Here we show how (i) considered formulation of an aqueous probiotic suspension can facilitate delivery of viable probiotic bacteria to the gut and (ii) quantitate the effect of colonisation and proliferation of specific probiotic species on the human gut microbiota, using an in-vitro gut model. Our data revealed immediate colonisation and growth of three probiotic species in the luminal and mucosal compartments of the proximal and distal colon, and growth of a fourth species in the luminal proximal colon, leading to higher proximal and distal colonic lactate concentrations. The lactate stimulated growth of lactate-consuming bacteria, altering the bacterial diversity of the microbiota and resulting in increased short-chain fatty acid production, especially butyrate. Additionally, an immunomodulatory effect of the probiotics was seen; production of anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and IL-10) was increased and production of inflammatory chemokines (MCP-1, CXCL10 and IL-8.) was reduced. The results indicate that the probiotic species alone do not result in a clinical effect; rather, they facilitate modulation of the gut microbiota composition and metabolic activity thereby influencing the immune response.

The lactate stimulated growth of lactate-consuming bacteria, altering the bacterial diversity of the microbiota and resulting in increased short-chain fatty acid production, especially butyrate. Additionally, an immunomodulatory effect of the probiotics was seen; production of anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and IL-10) was increased and production of inflammatory chemokines (MCP-1, CXCL10 and IL-8.) was reduced. The results indicate that the probiotic species alone do not result in a clinical effect; rather, they facilitate modulation of the gut microbiota composition and metabolic activity thereby influencing the immune response.
30446510	FLCN	PAT1	True Positive	FLCN is a novel Rab11A-interacting protein that is involved in the Rab11A-mediated recycling transport. The Birt-Hogg-Dub&#xe9; (BHD) syndrome related protein FLCN has recently been implicated in the vesicular trafficking processes by interacting with several Rab family GTPases. In the previous studies, we have shown that FLCN could inhibit the binding of overexpressed PAT1, which is a membrane-bound amino acid transporter, to the lysosome in human embryonic kidney 293 cells. This tends to stabilize the lysosomal amino acid pool that is a critical signal to activate the mTORC1 signaling pathway. However, the mechanisms of FLCN during this process remain unexplored. Here we report that FLCN can bind through its C-terminal DENN-like domain to the recycling transport regulator, Rab11A. Suppression of either Rab11A or FLCN facilitated the localization of the overexpressed PAT1 to the lysosome and inhibited its targeting on the plasma membrane. As a consequence, the mTORC1 was down-regulated. The <i>in vitro</i> GEF activity assay does not support FLCN modifies the Rab11A activity directly. Instead, we found FLCN promoted the loading of PAT1 on Rab11A. Our data uncover a function of FLCN in the Rab11A-mediated recycling pathway and might provide new clues to understand BHD.This article has an associated First Person interview with the first author of the paper.

30446621	MCT1	MCT2	True Negative	Membrane-anchored carbonic anhydrase IV interacts with monocarboxylate transporters via their chaperones CD147 and GP70. Monocarboxylate transporters (MCTs) mediate the proton-coupled exchange of high-energy metabolites, including lactate and pyruvate, between cells and tissues. The transport activity of MCT1, MCT2, and MCT4 can be facilitated by the extracellular carbonic anhydrase IV (CAIV) via a noncatalytic mechanism. Combining physiological measurements in HEK-293 cells and <i>Xenopus</i> oocytes with pulldown experiments, we analyzed the direct interaction between CAIV and the two MCT chaperones basigin (CD147) and embigin (GP70). Our results show that facilitation of MCT transport activity requires direct binding of CAIV to the transporters chaperones. We found that this binding is mediated by the highly conserved His-88 residue in CAIV, which is also the central residue of the enzyme's intramolecular proton shuttle, and a charged amino acid residue in the Ig1 domain of the chaperone. Although the position of the CAIV-binding site in the chaperone was conserved, the amino acid residue itself varied among different species. In human CD147, binding of CAIV was mediated by the negatively charged Glu-73 and in rat CD147 by the positively charged Lys-73. In rat GP70, we identified the positively charged Arg-130 as the binding site. Further analysis of the CAIV-binding site revealed that the His-88 in CAIV can either act as H donor or H acceptor for the hydrogen bond, depending on the charge of the binding residue in the chaperone. Our results suggest that the CAIV-mediated increase in MCT transport activity requires direct binding between CAIV-His-88 and a charged amino acid in the extracellular domain of the transporter's chaperone.

30446626	SETDB1	DPPA2	True Negative	SETDB1 is essential for mouse primordial germ cell fate determination by ensuring BMP signaling. In mouse embryos, primordial germ cells (PGCs) are fate-determined from epiblast cells. Signaling pathways involved in PGC formation have been identified, but their epigenetic mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we show that the histone methyltransferase SETDB1 is an epigenetic regulator of PGC fate determination. <i>Setdb1</i>-deficient embryos exhibit drastic reduction of nascent PGCs. <i>Dppa2</i>, <i>Otx2</i> and <i>Utf1</i> are de-repressed whereas mesoderm development-related genes, including BMP4 signaling-related genes, are downregulated by <i>Setdb1</i> knockdown during PGC-like cell (PGCLC) induction. In addition, binding of SETDB1 is observed at the flanking regions of <i>Dppa2</i>, <i>Otx2</i> and <i>Utf1</i> in cell aggregates containing PGCLCs, and trimethylation of lysine 9 of histone H3 is reduced by <i>Setdb1</i> knockdown at those regions.

In mouse embryos, primordial germ cells (PGCs) are fate-determined from epiblast cells.

30450735	TSG101	p53	True Positive	TSG101 promotes the proliferation, migration and invasion of hepatocellular carcinoma cells by regulating the PEG10. The tumour susceptibility gene 101 (TSG101) is reported to play important roles in the development and progression of several human cancers. However, its potential roles and underlined mechanisms in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are still needed to be further clarified. In the present study, we reported that knock down of TSG101 suppressed the proliferation, migration and invasion of HCC cells, while overexpression of TSG101 facilitated them. Molecularly, the results revealed that knock down of TSG101 significantly decreased the cell cycle related regulatory factor p53 and p21. In another point, knock down of TSG101 also obviously decreased the level of metallopeptidase inhibitor TIMP1 (Tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases 1), which results in inhibition of MMP2, MMP7 and MMP9. In contrast, overexpression of TSG101 had opposite effects. The iTRAQ proteomics analysis identified that oncogenic protein PEG10 (Paternally expressed gene 10) might be a potential downstream target of TSG101. Further investigation showed that TSG101 interacted with PEG10 and protected&#xa0;it&#xa0;from&#xa0;proteasomal&#xa0;degradation thereby regulating the expression of p53, p21 and MMPs. Finally, we found that both TSG101 and PEG10 proteins are up-regulated and presented a direct correlation in HCC patients. In conclusion, these results suggest that TSG101 is up-regulated in human HCC patients, which may accelerate the proliferation, migration and invasion of HCC cells through regulating PEG10.

The tumour susceptibility gene 101 (TSG101) is reported to play important roles in the development and progression of several human cancers. However, its potential roles and underlined mechanisms in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are still needed to be further clarified. In the present study, we reported that knock down of TSG101 suppressed the proliferation, migration and invasion of HCC cells, while overexpression of TSG101 facilitated them. Molecularly, the results revealed that knock down of TSG101 significantly decreased the cell cycle related regulatory factor p53 and p21. In another point, knock down of TSG101 also obviously decreased the level of metallopeptidase inhibitor TIMP1 (Tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases 1), which results in inhibition of MMP2, MMP7 and MMP9. In contrast, overexpression of TSG101 had opposite effects. The iTRAQ proteomics analysis identified that oncogenic protein PEG10 (Paternally expressed gene 10) might be a potential downstream target of TSG101. Further investigation showed that TSG101 interacted with PEG10 and protected&#xa0;it&#xa0;from&#xa0;proteasomal&#xa0;degradation thereby regulating the expression of p53, p21 and MMPs. Finally, we found that both TSG101 and PEG10 proteins are up-regulated and presented a direct correlation in HCC patients. In conclusion, these results suggest that TSG101 is up-regulated in human HCC patients, which may accelerate the proliferation, migration and invasion of HCC cells through regulating PEG10.

30452920	ATF4	DEFA1	True Positive	ATF4 Deficiency Promotes Intestinal Inflammation in Mice by Reducing Uptake of Glutamine and Expression of Antimicrobial Peptides. Activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) regulates genes involved in the inflammatory response, amino acid metabolism, autophagy, and endoplasmic reticulum stress. We investigated whether its activity is altered in patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) and mice with enterocolitis. We obtained biopsy samples during endoscopy from inflamed and/or uninflamed regions of the colon from 21 patients with active Crohn's disease (CD), 22 patients with active ulcerative colitis (UC), and 38 control individuals without IBD and of the ileum from 19 patients with active CD and 8 individuals without IBD in China. Mice with disruption of Atf4 specifically in intestinal epithelial cells (Atf4&#x394;IEC mice) and Atf4-floxed mice (controls) were given dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) to induce colitis. Some mice were given injections of recombinant defensin &#x3b1;1 DEFA1)and supplementation of l-alanyl-glutamine or glutamine in drinking water. Human and mouse ileal and colon tissues were analyzed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, immunoblots, and immunohistochemistry. Serum and intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) amino acids were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Levels of ATF4 were knocked down in IEC-18 cells with small interfering RNAs. Microbiomes were analyzed in ileal feces from mice by using 16S ribosomal DNA sequencing. Levels of ATF4 were significantly decreased in inflamed intestinal mucosa from patients with active CD or active UC compared with those from uninflamed regions or intestinal mucosa from control individuals. ATF4 was also decreased in colonic epithelia from mice with colitis vs mice without colitis. Atf4&#x394;IEC mice developed spontaneous enterocolitis and colitis of greater severity than control mice after administration of DSS. Atf4&#x394;IEC mice had decreased serum levels of glutamine and reduced levels of antimicrobial peptides, such as DEFA1, DEFA4, DEFA5, CAMP, and LYZ1, in ileal Paneth cells. Atf4&#x394;IEC mice had alterations in ileal microbiomes compared with control mice; these changes were reversed by administration of glutamine. Injections of DEFA1 reduced the severity of spontaneous enteritis and DSS-induced colitis in Atf4&#x394;IEC mice. We found that expression of solute carrier family 1 member 5 (SLC1A5), a glutamine transporter, was directly regulated by ATF4 in cell lines. Overexpression of SLC1A5 in IEC-18 or primary IEC cells increased glutamine uptake and expression of antimicrobial peptides. Knockdown of ATF4 in IEC-18 cells increased expression of inflammatory cytokines, whereas overexpression of SLC1A5 in the knockdown cells reduced cytokine expression. Levels of SLC1A5 were decreased in inflamed intestinal mucosa of patients with CD and UC and correlated with levels of ATF4. Levels of ATF4 are decreased in inflamed intestinal mucosa from patients with active CD or UC. In mice, ATF4 deficiency reduces glutamine uptake by intestinal epithelial cells and expression of antimicrobial peptides by decreasing transcription of Slc1a5. ATF4 might therefore be a target for the treatment of IBD.

Levels of ATF4 were knocked down in IEC-18 cells with small interfering RNAs. Microbiomes were analyzed in ileal feces from mice by using 16S ribosomal DNA sequencing. Levels of ATF4 were significantly decreased in inflamed intestinal mucosa from patients with active CD or active UC compared with those from uninflamed regions or intestinal mucosa from control individuals. ATF4 was also decreased in colonic epithelia from mice with colitis vs mice without colitis. Atf4&#x394;IEC mice developed spontaneous enterocolitis and colitis of greater severity than control mice after administration of DSS. Atf4&#x394;IEC mice had decreased serum levels of glutamine and reduced levels of antimicrobial peptides, such as DEFA1, DEFA4, DEFA5, CAMP, and LYZ1, in ileal Paneth cells. Atf4&#x394;IEC mice had alterations in ileal microbiomes compared with control mice; these changes were reversed by administration of glutamine. Injections of DEFA1 reduced the severity of spontaneous enteritis and DSS-induced colitis in Atf4&#x394;IEC mice. We found that expression of solute carrier family 1 member 5 (SLC1A5), a glutamine transporter, was directly regulated by ATF4 in cell lines. Overexpression of SLC1A5 in IEC-18 or primary IEC cells increased glutamine uptake and expression of antimicrobial peptides. Knockdown of ATF4 in IEC-18 cells increased expression of inflammatory cytokines, whereas overexpression of SLC1A5 in the knockdown cells reduced cytokine expression. Levels of SLC1A5 were decreased in inflamed intestinal mucosa of patients with CD and UC and correlated with levels of ATF4. Levels of ATF4 are decreased in inflamed intestinal mucosa from patients with active CD or UC. In mice, ATF4 deficiency reduces glutamine uptake by intestinal epithelial cells and expression of antimicrobial peptides by decreasing transcription of Slc1a5. ATF4 might therefore be a target for the treatment of IBD.

30452920	DEFA4	CAMP	True Negative	ATF4 Deficiency Promotes Intestinal Inflammation in Mice by Reducing Uptake of Glutamine and Expression of Antimicrobial Peptides. Activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) regulates genes involved in the inflammatory response, amino acid metabolism, autophagy, and endoplasmic reticulum stress. We investigated whether its activity is altered in patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) and mice with enterocolitis. We obtained biopsy samples during endoscopy from inflamed and/or uninflamed regions of the colon from 21 patients with active Crohn's disease (CD), 22 patients with active ulcerative colitis (UC), and 38 control individuals without IBD and of the ileum from 19 patients with active CD and 8 individuals without IBD in China. Mice with disruption of Atf4 specifically in intestinal epithelial cells (Atf4&#x394;IEC mice) and Atf4-floxed mice (controls) were given dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) to induce colitis. Some mice were given injections of recombinant defensin &#x3b1;1 DEFA1)and supplementation of l-alanyl-glutamine or glutamine in drinking water. Human and mouse ileal and colon tissues were analyzed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, immunoblots, and immunohistochemistry. Serum and intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) amino acids were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Levels of ATF4 were knocked down in IEC-18 cells with small interfering RNAs. Microbiomes were analyzed in ileal feces from mice by using 16S ribosomal DNA sequencing. Levels of ATF4 were significantly decreased in inflamed intestinal mucosa from patients with active CD or active UC compared with those from uninflamed regions or intestinal mucosa from control individuals. ATF4 was also decreased in colonic epithelia from mice with colitis vs mice without colitis. Atf4&#x394;IEC mice developed spontaneous enterocolitis and colitis of greater severity than control mice after administration of DSS. Atf4&#x394;IEC mice had decreased serum levels of glutamine and reduced levels of antimicrobial peptides, such as DEFA1, DEFA4, DEFA5, CAMP, and LYZ1, in ileal Paneth cells. Atf4&#x394;IEC mice had alterations in ileal microbiomes compared with control mice; these changes were reversed by administration of glutamine. Injections of DEFA1 reduced the severity of spontaneous enteritis and DSS-induced colitis in Atf4&#x394;IEC mice. We found that expression of solute carrier family 1 member 5 (SLC1A5), a glutamine transporter, was directly regulated by ATF4 in cell lines. Overexpression of SLC1A5 in IEC-18 or primary IEC cells increased glutamine uptake and expression of antimicrobial peptides. Knockdown of ATF4 in IEC-18 cells increased expression of inflammatory cytokines, whereas overexpression of SLC1A5 in the knockdown cells reduced cytokine expression. Levels of SLC1A5 were decreased in inflamed intestinal mucosa of patients with CD and UC and correlated with levels of ATF4. Levels of ATF4 are decreased in inflamed intestinal mucosa from patients with active CD or UC. In mice, ATF4 deficiency reduces glutamine uptake by intestinal epithelial cells and expression of antimicrobial peptides by decreasing transcription of Slc1a5.
