RESULTS: After 7 days hospitalisation, molar @PROTEIN$1:TTR ratio (mean+/-s.d.) of infected children (C-reactive proteins>10 mg/l) was 0.67+/-0.31 in the high-dose group (n=81), 0.74+/-0.44 in the low dose group (n=71) and 0.73+/-0.39 in the placebo group (n=81). These values did not differ significantly (one-way ANOVA P=0.472). In patients with baseline serum retinol concentrations<0.70 micromol/l, changes in RBP:TTR ratio between admission and day 7 were not statistically different in the three groups (one-way ANOVA P=0.548).

RESULTS: After 7 days hospitalisation, molar RBP:TTR ratio (mean+/-s.d.) of infected children (C-reactive proteins>10 mg/l) was 0.67+/-0.31 in the high-dose group (n=81), 0.74+/-0.44 in the low dose group (n=71) and 0.73+/-0.39 in the placebo group (n=81). These values did not differ significantly (one-way ANOVA P=0.472). In patients with baseline serum retinol concentrations<0.70 micromol/l, changes in RBP:@PROTEIN$1 ratio between admission and day 7 were not statistically different in the three groups (one-way ANOVA P=0.548).

RESULTS: After 7 days hospitalisation, molar RBP:TTR ratio (mean+/-s.d.) of infected children (C-reactive proteins>10 mg/l) was 0.67+/-0.31 in the high-dose group (n=81), 0.74+/-0.44 in the low dose group (n=71) and 0.73+/-0.39 in the placebo group (n=81).

RESULTS: After 7 days hospitalisation, molar @PROTEIN$1:@PROTEIN$2 ratio (mean+/-s.d.) of infected children (C-reactive proteins>10 mg/l) was 0.67+/-0.31 in the high-dose group (n=81), 0.74+/-0.44 in the low dose group (n=71) and 0.73+/-0.39 in the placebo group (n=81).

RESULTS: After 7 days hospitalisation, molar RBP:TTR ratio (mean+/-s.d.) of infected children (C-reactive proteins>10 mg/l) was 0.67+/-0.31 in the high-dose group (n=81), 0.74+/-0.44 in the low dose group (n=71) and 0.73+/-0.39 in the placebo group (n=81). These values did not differ significantly (one-way ANOVA P=0.472). In patients with baseline serum retinol concentrations<0.70 micromol/l, changes in @PROTEIN$1:TTR ratio between admission and day 7 were not statistically different in the three groups (one-way ANOVA P=0.548).

RESULTS: After 7 days hospitalisation, molar RBP:@PROTEIN$1 ratio (mean+/-s.d.) of infected children (C-reactive proteins>10 mg/l) was 0.67+/-0.31 in the high-dose group (n=81), 0.74+/-0.44 in the low dose group (n=71) and 0.73+/-0.39 in the placebo group (n=81).

RESULTS: After 7 days hospitalisation, molar RBP:TTR ratio (mean+/-s.d.) of infected children (C-reactive proteins>10 mg/l) was 0.67+/-0.31 in the high-dose group (n=81), 0.74+/-0.44 in the low dose group (n=71) and 0.73+/-0.39 in the placebo group (n=81). These values did not differ significantly (one-way ANOVA P=0.472). In patients with baseline serum retinol concentrations<0.70 micromol/l, changes in RBP:TTR ratio between admission and day 7 were not statistically different in the three groups (one-way ANOVA P=0.548).

Use of deletion mutants of @PROTEIN$1 suggested that @PROTEIN$2 homodimerization involves interactions between two distinct regions within the Bcl-2 protein, since a LexA protein containing Bcl-2 amino acids 83-218 mediated functional interactions with a B42 fusion protein containing Bcl-2 amino acids 1-81 but did not complement a B42 fusion protein containing Bcl-2 amino acids 83-218.	0	@PROTEIN$1	@PROTEIN$2
RESULTS: After 7 days hospitalisation, molar RBP:@PROTEIN$1 ratio (mean+/-s.d.) of infected children (C-reactive proteins>10 mg/l) was 0.67+/-0.31 in the high-dose group (n=81), 0.74+/-0.44 in the low dose group (n=71) and 0.73+/-0.39 in the placebo group (n=81). These values did not differ significantly (one-way ANOVA P=0.472). In patients with baseline serum retinol concentrations<0.70 micromol/l, changes in RBP:TTR ratio between admission and day 7 were not statistically different in the three groups (one-way ANOVA P=0.548). CONCLUSIONS: In this population of malnourished hospitalised children, molar @PROTEIN$2:TTR ratio does not appear to be useful to assess VA status during infection.
